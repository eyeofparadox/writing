the absolute and the abyss


The abyss becomes associatively linked to the rift, in the rift exile option of the demon within thread, because the exile's prison was envisioned as a place suspended outside of normal time and space. Where the idea of physical destruction is used to banish something, the concept of "exclusion" comes into play. The material aspect of an entity banished to the abyss, or rift, is literally excluded from creation, disassociated from time and space. A simple way of thinking of it is as if the exile has been turned "inside-out" and suspended from any material context. This is of course fatal, but it also binds the spirit, and thus the mind and soul. The nature of this binding turns the exile toward the soul of creation, away from the threshold, containing the exile's ghost within the deepest part of the host psyche.
