i familiars


There are physical and spiritual elements that combine to produce conditions like vampirism and metamorphism. 

A first generation vampire or were is created through an exchange of matter and energy with an angel or demon that makes them into familiars. 

The physical catalyst prompts the mingling of spiritual attributes and stimulates psychic potential to manifest as powers of regeneration, rejuvenation, transformation and or transmutation -- any of which can make the familiar immortal. 

The more pronounced the difference between two spirits, animal and elemental, the more likely it is for the animal to gain transformational or transmutational powers. 

In the case of vampires, death taints the process. 

It is generally assumed that vampires and weres are immune to being turned by each other's bites; in most cases, however, the bite is incapacitating and occasionally fatal. It is also assumed that a person bitten by a vampire and a were might inherit traits from both, but will ultimately be one or the other if the ordeal is not fatal, as it is in most cases. 


The reason a were often reverts to human form when killed is because the shift is a survival mechanism, the metamorphosis is accompanied by massive regeneration. 

it was fairly common for vampires to claim were familiars; the familiar would act as the vampire’s agent and provide protection during the day. in most cases, the familiar started out as a human servant or protégé who became infected by a were while acting as the vampire's agent. the establishment of the vampire's patronage prior to the were being turned was the precedent used to overrule the were sire's claim.
