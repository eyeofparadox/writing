:: psychics and metaphysics ::

A soul is absolute, creating itself by imposing limits upon itself, the structure of a mind though which it manifests itself and is accessible to other minds. The destruction of a soul is a curious thing, a paradox; it restores a soul to it's primal infinite, eternal, unbounded state. The end is just a new beginning. 

A soul is unique, uniform and united in the understanding of point paradox. 

The simplest expression of point paradox is the paradox of awareness: in the awareness of nothing, awareness is everything; in the awareness of everything, awareness is nothing -- I am awareness. 

Awareness is exclusively inclusive and inclusively exclusive.  

A soul is incarnated through psychic affinity for the potential inherent in the union of its prospective parents. As a couple becomes intimate, focusing attention on each other, the implications of their union become apparent to a naked psyche.
