The flesh and the spirit are both vehicles for the mind, and the mind that is the true key to understanding the mysteries of existence. All entities exist on the threshold of the mind. An individual's practical existence is defined by the limits of its mind. 

The relationship between the spiritual and the physical is essentially that of concept and construct, the true nature of each is information, but the manner in which that information is employed makes all the difference. Information is abstracted and manifested in ways that engage the mind and cause it to evolve. 

Angels and demons are conceived and born spiritually, able to manifest themselves physically as they see fit, while humans are conceived and born physically and able to manifest spiritually as they see fit. 

Humans and animals, dependent upon the construct of physicality, are subject to physical mortality, while angels and demons, dependent upon the concept of spirituality, are subject to spiritual mortality. 


A ghost, the sustained psyche of a deceased human being, tends to be static, while a god is dynamic and able to continue growing and refining itself. 

A ghost (the spiritual embodiment of an animal) is generally different from an angel or demon (the spiritual embodiment of an elemental) by virtue of self-posession, and thus is properly classified as a soul, rather than a spirit (the memory or psychic residue of a person) or elemental (a meme or archetype).
