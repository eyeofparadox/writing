Among the options explored up to this point is a way to establish the main character as a boy and a girl in different splinters of reality and a way for them to be eclipsed and fused through interaction with the demon of the realm. Previously, threads tended to be absorbed by the parents that were intended for the main character. 

The advantage of establishing the two versions of the main character in splinter realms and bringing them together for the ordeal of the child of fusion is that ideas do not get displaced or repeated. The consequence of the combined splinter incarnations and child of fusion threads is that a new incarnation of the protagonist is created in a process that displaces the parent incarnations. 

The problem encountered using the splintered realms approach was that it eliminated the girl's family ties. Most of her family was slain in the massacre and she was in no condition to identify them when she arrived in the boy's realm. However, if her ability to rift walk is trained, it is reasonable for her to return to her native realm to find out what happened to her and learn about her origins. 

The ability to rift walk is based on the psychic potential for manipulating the media of space, time and mind. The lesser ability allows an individual to possess his or her splinter incarnations -- though few consider the existence of, or contemplate possessing, a splinter of the opposite sex. The greater ability allows an individual to cross the rift between splinter realms physically. 

The demon within thread starts with the girl, but is based upon her psychic potential giving her the potential to touch -- and cross -- the threshold. The trauma of her childhood forced her to call upon that potential. The ordeal can still feature the assimilation of a demon created by the fall of the angel of the focus. There are a number of specific details that need to be worked out.
