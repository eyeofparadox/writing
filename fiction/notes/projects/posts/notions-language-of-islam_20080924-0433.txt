Islam is a difficult religion to study because the only legitimate form of the scripture is in arabic. Islam requires the Koran be read and interpreted in arabic. Islam also uses many other scriptures to support and give context to the Koran. There are many parts that can not be understood without an understanding of the related text. When scholars, who so know arabic and have studied the Koran and related scripture, say that strict interpretation of the Koran compells Muslims to conquer the world and convert everyone to Islam, I would take that as an informed opinion and present it as such, but it is not a substitute for learning arabic, studing Islam and interpreting it for myself.
