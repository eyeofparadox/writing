\i{Oh, you're one of those.} 

Categorization, sarcastic. A device used to diminish one's opposition. Contributes nothing to the thread. 

\i{Prove that you aren't hiding under anonymity yourself.}

This is a particularly lazy ripost, requiring the opposition to disprove a negative. Incidentally, another attempt to belittle by challenging, again, the integrity of the opposition. Contributes nothing to the thread. 

\i{In any case, I've told you why I think your reasoning is fallacious.} 

\blue{Too late, I'm afraid. You would give a better impression if you confined yourself to showing how existing phenomenon worked instead of explaining the imaginary. The trailing part ("... and if you believe ...") talks about telepathy as if it actually was proven. The net result is that the whole discussion is a form of "begging the question" fallacy. If you want to avoid being "perceived as a crank, kook or con artist" then you should avoid speaking as one.}

I can see where you told me that my reasoning is fellacious, but as for why... that's pretty thin, and I've already responded adequately in defence of my writing voice. If you have not grasped that by now, then I have serious doubts about your ability to comprehend what you read. Contributes nothing to the thread. 

\i{Why are you being so defensive? Is anyone who thinks you have a pointless argument automatically attacking you personally?} 

When one is attacked, one defends out of necessity. It is the only sensible response to bullying. Or, did you not open your "debate" with the following?: \blue{"Maybe you should wait until after you die then you wouldn't miss any potential highlights."} Contributes nothing to the thread. 

\i{Does it justify personal attacks on others?}

You set the tone, stupid. How could you even ask such a dumb question. Contributes nothing to the thread. Responding to you no longer qualifies as participating in the discussion defined as the topic of this thread. Please stop wasting everyone's time.


\i{\blue{You set the tone, stupid.} Ad hominem truly is the last resort of a weak argument isn't it?}

Like a dog with a bone... Pardon me if I recognize that sometimes it is best to call a thing what it is. Please, take it as a personal attack, take it as a low blow. I was insulting you, you dolt! By this point, you truly deserve to be insulted. This was never an arguement. It's been a fight, and you picked it. As for sense of humor, boy, I am laughing my ass off at you every time you post. You are utterly ridiculous. You have a degree of intelligence, but you are lacking in perception, adaptability, creativity and decorum. You do not acknowledge or respond to my specific responses to your attacks, but instead jump on some other phrase that \i{you} perceive as weak, and try to chew it apart as if it were the foundation of my whole arguement. When I deflect that, you go back to crying out the same complaints you started with. Are you mental?

\i{Of course, you took it out of context which changes the meaning immensely.}

Hey, \blue{What?}... your opening remarks to me were the equivalent of "shut up and die".  

\i{I suppose you are aware that no one is going to go back to find out what really was said. Another of your attacking replies Mr. Ad Hominem?}

Maybe it would help if \i{you} went back tofind out what was really said. I am tired of repeating myself. 

\i{Bad reasoning and and hominem defense. We're done here.}

Thank you! Maybe now we can see some posts that are \b{ON TOPIC!}
