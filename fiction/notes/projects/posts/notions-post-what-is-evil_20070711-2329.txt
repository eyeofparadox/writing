There is a line in "The Matrix" when Morpheus confronts Neo about a wrongness in the world, "like a splinter in your mind" and while it was caused by an instinctive apprehension about the artificial reality he was trapped in, it is similar to a feeling many people have about our own reality. There is a wrongness in the world, evident in the mystery of life, the inevitability of death and in the things that we call evil. There is something we all sense is missing or distorted, some question not asked or some answer that cannot be found. When asked why there is suffering in the world, even the wisest of people are hesitant to tell the truth. Why do we have pain, fear, anger, hatred and suffering? Why does evil like this exist?

The real question what makes them evil? More importantly, could we survive without them? Pain exists to warn us of danger and damage to our bodies, spirits, minds and even our souls. Fear warns us about things in our world that we must not take for granted and ignore. Anger drives us to fight against that which would harm us, it gives us the strength to attack - without which we are naturally too peaceful to do! Hatred, though it is such a dark emotion, and one that often takes control of us and blinds us, is designed to drive us to destroy that which is threatening to us. Suffering, which can be born of all these dark emotions, is the price we pay for allowing any of them to continue beyond their purpose. 

It is not hard to recognize that wanting something we do not (or worse, can not) have leads to suffering, but that is a hard thing for us to really confront. Wanting something we do not have can blind us to everything we do have, and wanting something we can never afford can compel us to simply try taking it, and taking things by force simply promotes suffering. That suffering is only compounded by the actions and the consequences of actions that are motivated by greed, hatred, spite, lust, jealousy, envy, pride, gluttony, wrath... and each of those terrible impulses are born from an imbalance, a hollowness in people that is difficult to explain or remedy. 

There have always people who believe that there is no higher truth and that wealth, status, achievement and comfort are the best that can be hoped for in life, and that choosing to seek for more, for some spiritual truth, is a path that can only bring suffering. If we were to apply the usual logic for defining evil, these people are inclined to view hope and belief as evil and disruptive influences. The extremes to which some people go in the name of faith certainly support such a view. However, this only proves that evil a concept of our own making and a relative one at that. 

Life is hard. Even when it is without strife or evil, there is a great deal of suffering inherent in life. This is what drives us in the pursuit of happiness, but the comfort and contentment of a life of ease does not save us from suffering either. Fleeting moments of happiness and joy, while they might make life very pleasant, do not give life enough purpose on their own. Even an ideal life is filled with many forms of discontent, such as boredom, frustration, anxiety, confusion... there are so many stresses in life that even the best possible life can be distressing. Even when a person takes life completely for granted, he or she will still be confronted with things that make them think and ask the one question that is never sufficiently answered: why? 

As long as human beings are capable of asking "why?" human beings will experience discontent and suffering. That suffering is born from the desire to know the answer, to understand. We are not meant to live constantly in states of pain or pleasure, fear or desire, anger or joy, hatred or lust. Our "evil" impulses are as vital to us as teeth and claws are to a wolf or lion. They are not evil in themselves. They are only evil in their abuse. They are the natural defenses and weapons we were created with, and we are ignorant in their use because they are such a natural part of ourselves. We can only tame them, control them, or harness them, by taming, controlling and harnessing ourselves. 

There are certain things in existence that deserve to be considered evil, because they have no redeeming qualities, but human beings are not one of them. People can and do commit evil acts and think evil thoughts, and they can do so with good or evil intent. People can be evil, in the sense that they can become so warped that they are a threat to anyone they come in contact with. But that is simply an extension of the evil that has been done to them. They are dangerous because they are wounded, growing more dangerous the more maimed and scarred they get. Even the most warped and perverted individual can possess a redeeming quality or commit a redeeming thought or act, however. The idea that people are inherently evil is far more evil than any person can ever be. To deny a person the possability of redemption is evil. 

Why? The question remains. What is evil? Evil is the state of things being wrong. Out of tune, out of order, out of place, out of context, out of balance, however we try to phrase it, it is something we have a natural and instinctive ability to recognize; the compliment to our natural perception of the truth. For every instance in which the universe can manifest itself properly, there exists a definition of potential evil. Evil is dependant on perspective and context. Ultimately, evil surves a purpose, which gives it a redeeming quality. Thus, the existence of evil is not inherently evil.

Buddha looked at the world and saw part of the truth: the nature of human desire and its capacity to cause suffering in the world. But, like pain, fear, anger, hatred and suffering, desire is also an essential part of us. Like the rest, desire can be out of balance and rule us. 

Buddhism has provided millions of people with the discipline to limit desire and allow compassion to guide them. The cost, however, is one that should be considered, for in the absence of desire, all desire, a person surrenders his or her soul. If it were a matter of simply relinquishing a concept, that would not be anything to worry about. On the other hand, it has to be asked if a soul is something that can be lost, stolen, sold or surrendered, when you consider that you are your soul. No soul would mean no you. No souls would mean no people and no people means that none of this really matters. That is not what the lesson of suffering teaches. Suffering has no point or purpose or even relevance if it is not endured; suffering allows us to know the truth of our selves, the truth of our existence. Suffering does not just make us better people, it is the very proof of our existence.

The question is, how can a person achieve peace and happiness knowing that other people are suffering? This is the nature of true compassion, and the root of love. When one feels true compassion or love, the well-being of others or at least one other comes before one's own happiness. 


Islam is a difficult religion to study because the only legitimate form of the scripture is in arabic. Islam requires the Koran be read and interpreted in arabic. Islam also uses many other scriptures to support and give context to the Koran. There are many parts that can not be understood without an understanding of the related text. When scholars, who so know arabic and have studied the Koran and related scripture, say that strict interpretation of the Koran compells Muslims to conquer the world and convert everyone to Islam, I would take that as an informed opinion and present it as such, but it is not a substitute for learning arabic, studing Islam and interpreting it for myself.
