What differentiates the act of simply grouping people from the act of stereotyping? How can stereotyping effect group relations? Give an example of a stereotype you find in your everyday life. Comment on the experiences of your classmates--are they the same or different from yours, and how?
 
Grouping is an activity that comes instinctively and automatically to people. It is part of a filtering process that allows us to make sense of our universe. Anything can serve as criteria for grouping, but because this is a perceptual-interpretive process, differences and similarities in physical characteristics are the most prevalent. As we learn and grow, we also associate ideas and experiences with the items in our cognitive inventory. We give values to people, places and things based on personal experience, inherited attitudes and beliefs, and assumptions. Part of our ability to form instant impressions and make immediate judgements is based upon preconception--ideas we have formed previously. Stereotyping is the result of reaching conclusions based on limited observation or information--often inaccurate or unreliable information. The thing that really differentiates the act of grouping people from the act of stereotyping is thinking. When grouping, you are engaged in a thinking process, perceiving and interpreting raw information, but when stereotyping you are simply calling up some predigested conclusion to save the time, effort and attention required to make an accurate and appropriate judgement. It is called "jumping to conclusions" and it is something we do so much that we rarely even notice it. What this means for social relations is disastrous. By assuming that we "know" what we are confronting when we encounter another human being, we actually fail to perceive that individual as a person. We not only take him or her for granted, we automatically dismiss them as being worthy of greater consideration.
