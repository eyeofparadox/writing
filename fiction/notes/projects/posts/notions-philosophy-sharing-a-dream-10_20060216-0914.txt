In that case, you are missing the point of everything I have said and everything that has been presented in this thread. Stop for a moment and ask yourself if you have honestly engaged in an effort to understand the ideas that have been presented, to consider them not on the basis of what you already know or how you currently think but in terms of what they illustrate. How can you possibly judge the merit of an idea if you don't even understand it, if you mind will not even encompass it? I am not asking you to do anything more difficult than engage, temporarily, in imagination, even pure fantasy, to think freely and without restrictions about things in order to exercise the intelligence that you possess. I can assure you that even the wildest flight of fancy will do you no harm, and the experience might actually enlighten or inspire you. This process is essential to developing a mind that is capible of devising solutions to problems that do not have a pat or preforumlated answer. This process is essential to becoming the type of person who ignores the educated and authoritative assertion that "mechanical fight is impossible" and goes on to invent a plane. Science is dependant on observation and observation is dependant on point of view. I'm not trying to revolutionize science, I am trying to revolutionize point of view. I am saying that it is not only important to understand what you are looking at, but \b{how} you look at it as well.
