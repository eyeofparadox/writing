Hmmm… interesting. Like most psychic abilities, the real mystery lies in what the mind does. I have to thank you for introducing the concepts of cryptomnesia and emergence. I might have run across them before, but as they are presented here they make a nice impression. This is a good example of how to present a topic concerning a “paranormal” phenomenon for serious consideration. I can think of number of psychic abilities that could be considered in the context of emergence. Of course, the real problem with discussing psychic phenomena is the prevailing belief that such phenomena are external to and exclusive of other natural phenomena. The real trick is to approach the demonstrated phenomenon of the mind with the understanding that any material basis for awareness must address the potential for awareness in matter or energy. However subjective the mind might be, we cannot discount the fact that it is the lens through which objective reality is translated and focused into subjective experience.
