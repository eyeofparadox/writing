AV         6/1/01   10:24 PM been a while, hasn't it! I was laid off a few
                                  weeks ago and don't spend as much time on the
                                  internet now...

Kaori-Chan 6/1/01   10:24 PM =(
                                  
                                  Why were you laid off?  Did you get in
                                  trouble?

AV         6/1/01   10:26 PM oh no... the company was going under so they
                                  got rid of all the little people to see if
                                  they could survive

Kaori-Chan 6/1/01   10:28 PM oh.  =(  I'm sorry.

Kaori-Chan 6/1/01   10:30 PM Do you still have IRC?

AV         6/1/01   10:30 PM um... yeah... that's what I usually get on

                                  doing a fantastic job before you went WHUMP.

                                  you?
                                  

Kaori-Chan 6/2/01   11:10 PM simple, I have myself identified on connection
                                  to the server.

AV         6/2/01   11:11 PM how do you do that... automatically? or do you
                                  manually identify?
                                  

Kaori-Chan 6/2/01   11:11 PM in the IRC options under FILE, there is a
                                  PERFORM ON CONNECT window in one of the
                                  sub-sections.

                                  I am guessing I won't be back till 9:30 your
                                  time.

AV         6/3/01   8:16 PM  That's about right... I came on to let you
                                  know that I would be on between 9:30 and 10
                                  pm, my time... *hugs*

                                  it's the server I'm on.

                                  stay on

Kaori-Chan 6/6/01   11:04 PM I went to sleep around 1:30pm, after being up
                                  and doing the mail route for my father....
                                  then I slept until 11pm your time... =(
                                  
                                  I'm waiting for you right now... hoping you'll
                                  come back.

AV         6/7/01   7:25 PM  it's thursday evening... I am going to have to
                                  be up early tomorrow for work... so I won't be
                                  on much this evening. I am on now, it's around
                                  8 my time, and I have to be off by 10, because
                                  my brother needs the phone then for about an
                                  hour +

AV         6/10/01  9:01 PM  Once again, my brother delayed my arrival
                                  online... I hope you didn't come in and give
                                  up on me! But, I think you would have sent me
                                  a message if you missed me... hope you come on
                                  soon!
                                  
                                  Love, Alex

AV         6/10/01  9:51 PM  I am wondering if you're ocming on at all...
                                  Hope nothing's wrong... I guess I'll wait til
                                  11-11:30 my time to see if you show up... if
                                  not, well, I love you!

AV         6/12/01  9:43 PM  I was hoping you would be able to get on
                                  earlier... I miss you... 
                                  I waited until 10:30pm but getting up early is
                                  making staying up late really hard... much
                                  harder when you aren't there... I hope you
                                  will forgive me for not being here tonight. I
                                  love you...

AV         6/13/01  11:58 PM I love you! I missed you! Take care of
                                  yourself... I'll see you tomorrow night, I
                                  hope... (Thurs... if you don't get this until
                                  the morning)
                                  
                                  Alexandrea, Your One

Kaori-Chan 6/15/01  3:25 AM  I'm sorry I haven't been on lately...  I have
                                  been trying to get back on a normal schedule,
                                  and have been feeling tired around 3pm to 4pm.

Kaori-Chan 6/15/01  10:45 PM Alex..?

                                  I'm worried.

AV         6/17/01  10:07 PM Hey you! I'm sorry I missed you. I spent the
                                  weekend at a friend's house. He wants me to
                                  take care of his daughter for a week while
                                  he's working... and he's going to help me put
                                  together and publish a couple of romance
                                  novels! 
                                  
                                  I was worried about you too... I was not able
                                  to get in contact with you, could not get on
                                  irc and you weren't on ICQ when I had time on
                                  his computer...

                                  the killer and he's fooled everyone!

Kaori-Chan 6/29/01  10:53 PM well... probably around one or two your time
                                  tomorrow.

Kaori-Chan 6/29/01  11:14 PM *Laughs* it is... it very much is.  =)

                                  tried to talk to himm about being a good role
                                  player, and he, of course, ignored most of
                                  it... claims he is a good role player and does
                                  take initiative... ::shakes her head:: nice
                                  guy, but... I understand the frustration...

Kaori-Chan 6/29/01  11:32 PM it isn't the taking initiative... it's the
                                  bugging me all the time to roleplay.  ^>^ I am

Kaori-Chan 6/29/01  11:35 PM uhm... you might want to write the dream down

AV         6/29/01  11:37 PM I've sort of written it down... I described a
                                  big chunk of it to Candice... and, it was a
                                  many stage and very long dream... I didn't
                                  have time to write the whole thing down...
                                  however... if I remember a dream right after I
                                  wake up, I will usually remember the dream
                                  very well from that point on...

Kaori-Chan 6/30/01  5:45 PM  Alex, are you there?

AV         6/30/01  7:00 PM  Hello, Love...

AV         6/30/01  7:04 PM  Last night, we ended up delayed until the last
                                  showing of AI, and we got into a discussion on
                                  the way into the house... it was already 3 am
                                  when I checked the time and too late to talk
                                  to you... I didn't get to sleep for a couple
                                  of hours after that, and then overslept...

AV         6/30/01  7:06 PM  I think I woke up around 3:30 pm, and I had
                                  some chores to do before I could get on my
                                  computer... and then Launce told me about the
                                  conversation he had with you today... I was
                                  talking with him about it when you came on a
                                  few minutes ago...

AV         6/30/01  7:08 PM  ::she pauses and looks at you::

AV         6/30/01  7:12 PM  If you want to talk about it, I'd be happy
                                  to... I've listened to his explanations of
                                  what he was doing, and I read the
                                  conversation... but I have not heard your side
                                  of it... I'd be happy if you'd just say
                                  ANYTHING at this point...

AV         6/30/01  7:20 PM  hmmm... well, I guess you've wandered away
                                  from the keyboard... ::shrugs and smiles:: I'm
                                  around, I might be away from the computer for

                                  logs of your conversations with Launce and
                                  Avi,  what' I've read is a bit out of
                                  context... maybe I'll understand what happened
                                  if I can peruse the entire log... you know how
                                  it works, click on History and hit Save As and
                                  you can send those files to me...
                                  
                                  I'll see if I can sort this mess out... I
                                  really hate it when the people I care about
                                  can't get along with each other... 

AV         6/30/01  7:51 PM  are you actually gone, or just set to
                                  invisible?

Kaori-Chan 6/30/01  7:59 PM  I'm here.  I was upstairs.

AV         6/30/01  8:01 PM  oh, okay... do youhave time to talk now, or
                                  are you busy?

Kaori-Chan 6/30/01  8:03 PM  I can talk now, I am not busy.

                                  so, did you read what I sent earlier?

Kaori-Chan 6/30/01  8:06 PM  I did, and have been trying to do it since I
                                  came back downstairs.  It is freezing my ICQ
                                  whenever I try.

AV         6/30/01  8:10 PM  oh... that's weird...

                                  great... if not, oh well...

Kaori-Chan 6/30/01  8:17 PM  Just had to wait a hell of a long time to get
                                  it to work...
                                  
                                  Just sent them via e-mail, since it won't let
                                  you send files through ICQ.
                                  
                                  I am rather upset and depressed today, it's
                                  been a while since I felt upset.

                                  hers::

Kaori-Chan 6/30/01  8:20 PM  well, the whole reason I started the
                                  discussion I was talking about is because of
                                  my feelings towards online communities as well
                                  as the way society runs.
                                  
                                  I think perhaps Avi and Launce heard what they
                                  wanted to hear and interpreted in their own
                                  way without considering my intentions.  I also
                                  really hate being talked down to, as Launce
                                  did that to me for about two hours as if I
                                  needed to learn something from him.

Kaori-Chan 6/30/01  8:21 PM  largely I was discussing my opinions and
                                  views, and he says Avi never wants to speak to
                                  me again because of how revoltingly arrogant I
                                  was.

Kaori-Chan 6/30/01  8:31 PM  reading love?

                                  I had the feeling that there was a
                                  misunderstanding at the root of this... and,
                                  from talking to Launce and reading part of the
                                  conversations you had with him and Avi (I
                                  cauht only references to the second) it seems
                                  that they took issue not so much with what you
                                  were trying to say as the way you expressed
                                  it... 
                                  
                                  I know from you that you've had people accuse
                                  you of being arrogant before... I don't know
                                  yet what Avi based her opinion on, so I won't
                                  address that yet... as far as Launce... you do
                                  understand he wasn't getting personal, right?
                                  
                                  I can see that for whatever reason, Launce
                                  decided to test you... maybe you find it
                                  offensive for him to assert that he has
                                  something to teach you, but hold off on that
                                  for a moment... 

AV         6/30/01  8:32 PM  Launce does not mean any harm... 

Kaori-Chan 6/30/01  8:33 PM  I don't mind if he has something to teach me,
                                  but talking down to me is a good way to earn
                                  my dislike.

AV         6/30/01  8:35 PM  that's true... but, did you realize he was
                                  dong it on purpose? that was his intention, in
                                  part... if you dislike him at this point, then
                                  he accomplished exactly what he intended... I
                                  think the part that bother's Launce is that
                                  you did not rise above the bait, and you....
                                  grrr... I just got called to dinner.... I'll
                                  be right back

AV         6/30/01  8:49 PM  ::runs back upstairs with a plate of food::
                                  okay, I'm back... whre was I... oh, right...
                                  according to Launce, when he tried to make his
                                  final point, you didn't respond to it...
                                  now... here's a bit of inside info...
                                  apparently, you reminded Launce of himself
                                  when he was younger... he confesses that he
                                  had very similar beliefs
                                  
                                  he was attempting to assess your command of
                                  the Engish Language, and your native
                                  intelligence... and he was deliberately
                                  provoking you

Kaori-Chan 6/30/01  8:51 PM  yes, well, having one called "IGNORANT"
                                  Despite the level of truth to it does tend to
                                  grate on one.
                                  
                                  I didn't respond because of the fact that
                                  everyone is ignorant, no more and no less than
                                  Socrates himself.

AV         6/30/01  8:56 PM  when he offered to explain what the lesson
                                  was... when he asked you if you wanted to know
                                  what point he was trying to make, you didn't
                                  respond to that in a direct and appropriate
                                  manner... it would have been simple enough to
                                  say, "Okay, what's your point?" or simply say
                                  "yes" or "no"... but you did not do that...

Kaori-Chan 6/30/01  8:57 PM  I am not to be treated like a child by anyone.
                                  
                                  If someone wants to teach me something, they
                                  meet me as an equal, not as an inferior.  I
                                  extend the same courtesy.

Kaori-Chan 6/30/01  8:58 PM  I dislike the fact that he assumes I need to
                                  learn something from him, regardless of the
                                  truth, he talked down to me.  Sure, maybe he
                                  was testing me, but I will not give people the
                                  satisfaction of getting the response they want
                                  out of me when they prod me for it.

Kaori-Chan 6/30/01  9:01 PM  You should know better than anyone, my love,
                                  how I respond to confrontation... Fictitious
                                  or not.

AV         6/30/01  9:04 PM  yes... I do... and what I know suggest to me
                                  that you do have a lot to learn from Launce...
                                  
                                  
                                  but, the truth is, we all... ever person
                                  alive... have a great deal to learn from the
                                  people around us... 
                                  
                                  to expect people to treat you in a particular
                                  way is both self important and unrealistic...
                                  and presenting such an expectation is the
                                  surest way to provoke exactly the opposite
                                  treatment... 

Kaori-Chan 6/30/01  9:07 PM  that's just as true for him as it is for me...
                                  
                                  I don't expect anything, and I don't care
                                  about what others think about my opinions. 
                                  That's why they're my opinions.
                                  
                                  Everyone has them, and everyone thinks the
                                  other persons stinks.

Kaori-Chan 6/30/01  9:07 PM  you really shouldn't love me, Alex.  You
                                  really shouldn't.

AV         6/30/01  9:08 PM  now... the question you need to ask yourself
                                  right now is... if Launce has so little
                                  respect for you, why the hell did he invest
                                  two plus hours in talking to you... if he only
                                  wanted to insult you or "put you in your
                                  place" why waste so much time?
                                  
                                  he has taken an interest in you... he has made
                                  an investment in you... and you have no
                                  appreciation for it at all...

Kaori-Chan 6/30/01  9:08 PM  wrong, I just don't care.
                                  
                                  I do not care.
                                  
                                  I tried that caring thing, it didn't work for
                                  me, I got burned.

AV         6/30/01  9:09 PM  I can't explain why I love you... and I have
                                  already established that I can't, for purely
                                  practical reasons, choose not to love you...
                                  it does not work that way

Kaori-Chan 6/30/01  9:13 PM  of course that's a lie, I don't mean what I
                                  just said...
                                  
                                  look.  I am a borderline effing recluse, and
                                  have lived alone for a long long time.  My
                                  opinions and the way I live my life make it
                                  hard for others to even stand being around me.
                                  
                                  And you are right, and you should remember
                                  when you are right, when you say that I am far
                                  far more fragile than you.  When a person gets
                                  burned, they avoid that situation.
                                  
                                  I don't need my heart railroaded, I am
                                  sincerely naive and dense a lot of the time,
                                  but that doesn't mean I don't care when I hurt
                                  someone or make them not like me.
                                  
                                  So I offend someone, and then I have this guy
                                  jumping down my throat about how arrogant I am
                                  and how I should stop espousing how superior I
                                  am....
                                  
                                  you tell me how I should respond.

AV         6/30/01  9:18 PM  Launce heard you, at the beginning of his
                                  conversation with you today, say that you
                                  recognized your limits and ignorance, and that
                                  you were committed to improving yourself, and
                                  encouraging others to improve themselves...
                                  and for that reason, he tried to see if you
                                  would actually recognize an opportunity to
                                  improve yourself... in even a small way... and
                                  take it...
                                  
                                  you... obviously... do not care.... and that's
                                  the one thing that actually bothered Launce...
                                  bothered him enough to point it out to me, and
                                  spend a couple  more hours explaining what he
                                  was saying and thinking as he talked to you,
                                  and... then encourage me to go and try to
                                  smooth things out with you again...
                                  
                                  I am sorry if it hurts you, but... honestly...
                                  this whole thing was about self improvement...
                                  does it really matter to you?
                                  
                                  I, personally, do not think that Launce was
                                  the right person to engage you in this...
                                  however, he started with the assumption that
                                  you did not realize how you were presenting
                                  yourself...

Kaori-Chan 6/30/01  9:20 PM  Words are an inadequate medium to represent my

                                  it up.
                                  
                                  Self change is so hard for me as to be

                                  compared to other people.  I am behind
                                  socially, and lack skills that others
                                  developed in high school.  Stubborn, arrogant,
                                  and egotistical I refuse to listen to others
                                  even when I really should.  Only after making
                                  terrible mistakes and realizing it long, long
                                  after the fact do I ever actually change.

AV         6/30/01  9:28 PM  the person I love is... like many people, a

                                  warped perspective that never rang true... but
                                  which does fit into a world where the truth is
                                  ignored in favor of lifeless fact

                                  mind and soul... and, like me, he will put
                                  himself through hell before finally believing
                                  and accepting it...

                                  and hurt me and scare me... if that's what it
                                  took for me to wake up and stop lying to
                                  myself
                                  
                                  compared to them... in a manner of speaking...
                                  you really are a child...
                                  I do not say that to offend... nor should it
                                  offend
                                  
                                  there is nothing disgraceful about being a
                                  child... nor, in being treated like a child...
                                  
                                  
                                  children are treated in two ways... they are
                                  protected and nurtured as necessary... and
                                  ignored otherwise, until the find ways to
                                  distinguish themselves...
                                  
                                  the best suggestion I can offer you at this
                                  point is...
                                  
                                  stop feeling sorry for yourself!
                                  
                                  you have my love and there is nothing higher I
                                  can offer you... 
                                  if you are willing to set aside your self
                                  pity, you will be able to keep my love
                                  
                                  not because I won't give it to if you don't,
                                  but because you will find a way to drive me
                                  away if you don't
                                  
                                  THIS is who you love

AV         6/30/01  9:34 PM  ...

Kaori-Chan 6/30/01  9:36 PM  I am not pitying myself.  I only acknowledge
                                  my own flaws.
                                  
                                  Frankly, I was never as arrogant as I am now,
                                  after meeting you.  I prefer confident,
                                  positive, happy.
                                  
                                  It doesn't matter to me what Launce thinks I
                                  should learn, it doesn't matter to me if
                                  Aviendha never talks to me again.  None of
                                  that matters to me, because it's all
                                  unimportant beside you.
                                  
                                  Perhaps that might offend you, but it's the
                                  only truth that I know.

AV         6/30/01  9:39 PM  is this your normal attitude, or is it how you
                                  feel now, after this confrontation with
                                  Launce?

Kaori-Chan 6/30/01  9:39 PM  why?

AV         6/30/01  9:49 PM  because it does not sound like the attitude of
                                  respect... you claimed to have for everyone...
                                  how can you respect someone if you don't care
                                  what they think or feel? 
                                  
                                  these are my FRIENDS... these are the people
                                  who filled in for the family that I never
                                  really had... the people I lived for when I
                                  could not stand to live... and the people I
                                  would die for until I found you...
                                  
                                  these people should be somewhat important
                                  BECAUSE of me... it really bothers me that Avi
                                  said she never wants to talk to you  again... 
                                  
                                  it does not offend me, I understand how
                                  important I am to you... but, I am
                                  concerned... right now my main concern is
                                  that... you're so stubborn... this is such a
                                  small issue, really... but it can turn into a
                                  mountain easily enough...
                                  
                                  I matter to my friends... they will have a
                                  very different perspective than I... they will
                                  push you, even if I don't... they will not be
                                  afraid to shame you in my eyes if they feel
                                  you're hopeless, and feel I would be better
                                  off without you...

AV         6/30/01  9:50 PM  I don't want that to happen

AV         6/30/01  9:54 PM  ::sigh:: I did warn you about Launce...
                                  ::caresses your cheek fondly::

Kaori-Chan 6/30/01  9:54 PM  If that's what is going to happen, then you
                                  really should get out now...
                                  
                                  because that is what ALWAYS happens with me.
                                  
                                  

AV         6/30/01  9:55 PM  are you proud of that?

Kaori-Chan 6/30/01  9:56 PM  I'm about just ready to give up.  I doubt I'm
                                  the man you think I am.

AV         6/30/01  10:01 PM it's a very dark and lonely place you're
                                  daring me to send you... I told you that this
                                  is the surest way to piss me off... being like
                                  this... and that nothing would make you leave
                                  you like this... I will not walk away from
                                  you! 
                                  
                                  I understand your doubts, but... damn it! I
                                  belive in you... I think I understand you
                                  better than you understand yourself
                                  sometimes... this is your frustration
                                  speaking... and no doubt, you are insanely
                                  frustrated... you were not meant for a world
                                  like this, and we both know it.
                                  
                                  don't you dare give up on yourself! don't you
                                  DARE leave me alone again!

Kaori-Chan 6/30/01  10:02 PM Fine, Alex...
                                  
                                  *Sighs*.
                                  
                                  No, I don't care about Launce.  I don't care
                                  about your friends.
                                  I don't even care about my own family.
                                  
                                  And at times, I want the whole world to die,
                                  and feel that all of them deserve it.
                                  
                                  You satisfied?

AV         6/30/01  10:06 PM you are not the only one who has ever felt
                                  this way... I have felt this way... all of my
                                  friends have felt this way... we've all been
                                  there Mark... 
                                  
                                  this road leads to suicide, one way or the
                                  other... is that a road you really want to go
                                  down?

Kaori-Chan 6/30/01  10:07 PM when people keep making the same decisions, I
                                  don't really care if I fly off a cliff.

Kaori-Chan 6/30/01  10:08 PM ceaseless.  Unchanging, how people treat me,
                                  how they expect me to listen to them as if I
                                  was some child... how they all become offended
                                  and then eventually give up on me because I
                                  never change, ceaseless, and unchanging.

AV         6/30/01  10:08 PM do I sound like I am giving up on you?

Kaori-Chan 6/30/01  10:08 PM I leech.  Look for sympathy, I demand people
                                  do things my way, roleplay what I want, do
                                  what I want, I make myself their problem.

AV         6/30/01  10:09 PM why?

AV         6/30/01  10:09 PM what's the point?

Kaori-Chan 6/30/01  10:09 PM no, you don't sound like you're giving up on
                                  me, but you are telling me that your friends
                                  will run you into the ground because I will
                                  not listen to them.
                                  
                                  Ever.
                                  
                                  Only when I choose to listen will I listen,
                                  and never otherwise.

Kaori-Chan 6/30/01  10:10 PM Because I like hurting people when I don't get
                                  my way, get it?
                                  
                                  I am spoiled... I want things to go my way, I
                                  want things to be like they were and they
                                  never are.
                                  
                                  People always want to try and change me,
                                  improve me, make me better than I was without
                                  even asking me if it's alright.
                                  
                                  Then they get angry, and they deserve to be
                                  hurt when they expect something they don't
                                  deserve.

AV         6/30/01  10:12 PM yes... I do get it... and so do they...

Kaori-Chan 6/30/01  10:13 PM if anyone wants to change me, I will set the
                                  rules, do you understand? I will tell them how
                                  and what I will allow, and if they don't like
                                  it, they can leave.  They can abandon me, like
                                  all the others, because they want to do things
                                  THEIR way.  I do not ask for much, I only ask
                                  that people treat me as they would treat
                                  themselves... I don't like being called
                                  ignorant, and I don't like being forced to
                                  make a change that I am not ready or willing
                                  to make.
                                  
                                  I make my own changes in time, and nobody
                                  else.  People can influence me, give me
                                  advice, but nobody... NOBODY tells me what is
                                  what.

AV         6/30/01  10:24 PM then say that right up front... don't try to
                                  ease it out, don't work up to it... don't
                                  candy coat it... it is a very offensive
                                  attitude... arrogant and self important, and
                                  for most people unacceptible... but, an
                                  intelligent person won't get emotional and
                                  won't react... if you won't deal with people
                                  except on your own terms, spell those terms
                                  out and... ask for their terms... 
                                  
                                  it's a two way street... you don't want to
                                  play by the established rules... fine... but,
                                  if you expect to be treated special, expect
                                  the other person to be just as demanding...
                                  don't pretend that your attitude is not
                                  provokative
                                  
                                  ::shakes her head and sighs:: 
                                  
                                  Mark, I love you... I am starting to speak in
                                  very harsh terms... and it has to be driving
                                  you nuts... you're driving me nuts too...
                                  there is so much more that needs to be said,
                                  so much more that needs to be seen... I will
                                  be patient with you... I sincerly hope you can
                                  understand... I do think you need to change...
                                  but, really, starting with... you need to want
                                  to change... I can't give you that... I can't
                                  demand that... all I can say is... I can see
                                  so much potential in you, and... only you can
                                  bring it out... if I did not love you so much,
                                  that potential would still compell me to act
                                  
                                  I would become your worst enemy if it would
                                  encourage you to become the best you can be...
                                  instead, I am... your almost helpless ally...
                                  
                                  sometimes I am afraid to simply say what I
                                  think to you, because you have such thin
                                  skin... I worry that you are too easily hurt,
                                  and that... whether I want to of not, I will
                                  drive you away from me...

Kaori-Chan 6/30/01  10:28 PM and that's a very real threat, Alex... I won't
                                  lie to you.  I've never lied to you.
                                  
                                  and anyone can change me, they just have to
                                  follow the rules.  Play the game...
                                  
                                  too many people don't bother.  I don't know
                                  all the rules, I only know how I react to
                                  things and how I don't react to things.  And,
                                  for christ's sake, alex... when I say that
                                  Launce was wrong to approach me in that
                                  manner, he was wrong, because there are a
                                  thousand ways to teach a person anything, and
                                  if he cared about me learning he would have
                                  seen I was reacting negatively and tried
                                  another method.
                                  
                                  that's what an Intelligent person would do.
                                  

Kaori-Chan 6/30/01  10:30 PM I feel and believe Launce was wrong to do what
                                  he did, when all I was looking for was someone
                                  to understand what I meant, not some argument.
                                   And I definitely don't think highly of Avi
                                  since she decided I was pompous when I hadn't
                                  even finished what I was talking about.  Only
                                  when confronted as Launce confronted me do I
                                  turn off to people, and not want to talk to
                                  them.
                                  
                                  I prefer talking out problems than letting
                                  them sit there... and I do not understand, and
                                  cannot understand people who expect that
                                  leaving hatred between two people is perfectly
                                  fine.

AV         6/30/01  10:31 PM unfortunately, Launce is more like you than
                                  you know... he only deals with people on his
                                  own terms, and he... likes to hurt people when
                                  he doesn't get his way... I agree with you...
                                  Launce handled you in the wrong way... 

Kaori-Chan 6/30/01  10:33 PM thank you, that's all I wanted to hear, that
                                  you felt he didn't understand how to deal with
                                  me... because it offended and hurt my feelings
                                  that he presumed to think he understood me and
                                  how to "HANDLE" people like me.

AV         6/30/01  10:45 PM the problem is... I don't see any way to clean
                                  this up... Launce has taken an interest in
                                  you, and it is not a malicious interest... he
                                  is ruthless, that is true... but he was only
                                  trying to get you to admit most of the things
                                  you have admitted to me
                                  
                                  he was only trying to get you to show him what
                                  you're really made of... and... I don't know
                                  if he'll ever change. In his own mind, he has
                                  paid you a rare bit of respect... I don't want
                                  to tell you not to talk to him again... I am
                                  sure you don't WANT to, at this point
                                  
                                  if you do talk to him, just send him a copy of
                                  this conversation... make it clear that he did
                                  hurt your feelings... you have to decide for
                                  yourself if you are willing to listen to his
                                  diatribes... it doesn't hurt to listen... and
                                  you don't have to agree with him... you don't
                                  have to change at all... but, you might still
                                  learn things anyway... 
                                  
                                  it's up to you... my friends are my friends,
                                  and I am used to being close to people who
                                  literally hate each other's guts... I've had
                                  friends who went so far as to try to kill each
                                  other! You don't owe it to me to like
                                  anybody... 

Kaori-Chan 6/30/01  10:47 PM thank you... I was afraid you were asking me
                                  to do just that, which I would not have
                                  responded well to.

AV         6/30/01  10:53 PM at this point, no one here hates you... people
                                  are just feeling you out, and, honestly, even
                                  at your worst, you are no worse than any of us
                                  have been... we have all got strong
                                  opinions... we all demand a certain amount of
                                  respect in normal circumstances, and because
                                  we do not take each other for granted, we can
                                  be brutally honest, and ruthlessly offensive
                                  with each other... we play hard ball... we
                                  have no use for any other kind of game... 
                                  
                                  but we love each other, and watch each other's
                                  backs... we are the kind of people you wish
                                  you had known in your own home town... you are
                                  welcome among us... I suggest you talk to
                                  Launce... and Candice (Ldy_Kiara) about our
                                  notions of friendship, and our expectations of
                                  our friends... so you know how we think, and
                                  whether it's something you want to be a part
                                  of... that's all I ask of you, make that much
                                  effort at least... find out what you're
                                  turning down... before you turn it down
                                  
                                  just consider, these people are my friends for
                                  a reason... I love you, so that tells you how
                                  tolerant I am of the foiables of those I care
                                  about... beyond that, it's just you and me....
                                  
                                  two as one, whole

Kaori-Chan 6/30/01  11:00 PM that's all I wanted, Alex.. just you.

AV         6/30/01  11:08 PM ::holds you close:: 
                                  
                                  my only concern about how you get on with my
                                  friends is... I am not the kind of person to
                                  walk away from my friends... if you take no
                                  interest in each other, that is fine... but if
                                  you hate each other... it would tear me apart
                                  
                                  I really don't want to step into the middle of
                                  any more duels!
                                  
                                  and hey... if you were worried that you had
                                  somehow disappointed me in this matter... I
                                  expected this to happen... the way you acted
                                  did not surprise me or offend me... you have
                                  not been lessened in my eyes... I love you for
                                  who you are... I do not have any illusions
                                  about you... as much as I see in you a better
                                  man than you belive yourself to be, I accept
                                  you for the man you are
                                  
                                  you do not have to change for me... but, you
                                  might have to change for yourself... change is
                                  a part of life... I know that those changes
                                  are up to you
                                  
                                  I will not force you to change, but I hope I
                                  can help you acheive the changes you desire

Kaori-Chan 6/30/01  11:12 PM just being here for me and listening to me is
                                  help enough.
                                  
                                  I may speak to him again...  though I will try
                                  not to speak to his girlfriend since she
                                  obviously dislikes my views...
                                  
                                  the reason I was discussing my elite views is
                                  that I am having it on my mind from a forum
                                  I've attended for years.

AV         6/30/01  11:22 PM hmmm... I just read through your conversation
                                  with her... from what I can see, you didn't
                                  cross any lines... this is a case of... a
                                  genuine misunderstanding... you were stating a
                                  very strong opinion... one I have heard from a
                                  lot of people, actually... the problem is, you
                                  can't control the tone of voice in a text
                                  interface... it's hard to pick up the context
                                  and flavor, and personality of the author...
                                  to someone who doesn't know you, who is
                                  forming their opinion of you based on this
                                  little bit of conversation, it's not hard to
                                  form the wrong impression... people are too
                                  complex to represent in words... I don't see
                                  anything here that cannot be overcome... this
                                  is not an accurate picture of you as a
                                  person... 
                                  
                                  we can give it some time and possible mend
                                  fences later... I can also see from your
                                  conversation with Avi where Launce took his
                                  main thrusts... I don't think either of them
                                  really got your point, they were both
                                  responding to certain statements you made
                                  
                                  I think that if you expressed these same views
                                  in another way, or at another time, she might
                                  not have been so easily offended... it might
                                  have been too much too soon... and you were in
                                  the wrong mood to boot... if you had actually
                                  had this conversation with Launce first, not
                                  Avi, it probably would have been a more
                                  productive exchange

Kaori-Chan 6/30/01  11:26 PM I think it was the last thing I said... the
                                  part about those who are compassionate know
                                  when to be cruel.

                                  My advice would be to at least offer an
                                  apology to Avi... something along the lines
                                  of, you got on a roll, thought you were
                                  engaging her in a conversation... something a
                                  little bit controversial... you did not mean
                                  to offend, you were just dwelling on a
                                  situation and combined a bit of venting with a
                                  bit of honest opinion... that's what it seems
                                  like to me, anyway... you are an opinionated
                                  brat, but you're not a bad person... 
                                  
                                  we all learn the same words, but we learn them
                                  in different contexts... I don't know too many
                                  people who really think about the dictionary
                                  definition of the words they use habitually...
                                  Launce was deliberately being a shit, but you
                                  weren't... I'll talk to Launce... I doubt I
                                  can change his attitude, but for the most part
                                  he was in a good humor about it
                                  
                                  in the future, when he seems about to go off
                                  on a rant, if you really don't feel like
                                  following along and seeing where he is going,
                                  don't engage him, but don't go silent... just
                                  indicate in some way that he's throwing you in
                                  the deep end and... you don't know how to
                                  swim...
                                  
                                  don't ever let it get to the point where your
                                  feelings are really getting hurt... 

Kaori-Chan 6/30/01  11:38 PM however strange my opinions are, I do have a
                                  tendency of politeness.

AV         6/30/01  11:59 PM well... the dream from the night before
                                  last... it was broken into two totally
                                  seperate chapters, so to speak...
                                  
                                  In the first dream, I was in my usual
                                  disguise... David, to the world around me... I
                                  was experimenting with a form of
                                  teleportation... I called it wave translation
                                  transportation, and it was akin to something I
                                  was working on (wave translation
                                  transformation) and to my surprise it
                                  worked... sort of... there was some sort of
                                  conflict going on, and I had to abort in the
                                  middle of the translation, popping out in the
                                  middle of some strange city, naked and
                                  alone... I found out from the people that
                                  first noticed me that they were familiar with
                                  the phenominon... so my great new ability was
                                  not particularly special where I ended up... I
                                  sort of flitted through what seemed like a few
                                  years of settling in to this new civilization
                                  and making a name for myself as something like
                                  a wizard...

AV         7/1/01   12:02 AM ...I remember some confict catching up to me,
                                  and a bunch of assassins coming to take me and
                                  my friends out... and by some strange miracle
                                  we all survived... some time later, I
                                  accidentally discovered a new aspect of my
                                  teleportation ability, still trying to figure
                                  out the transformation application, which sent
                                  me back in time... I realized that I had gone
                                  back to the assassination attempt, and coming
                                  out right in the middle of the killers, and
                                  being forced to take them all out to save my
                                  own skin, realizing at the last moment that I
                                  was the miracle that had saved everyone so
                                  many years in my past...

                                  psionic-holographic powers, was very familiar

                                  they affected me... I was capible of the
                                  basics, like telekinesis, levitation,
                                  telepathy and empathy... extra sensory
                                  perception, of course... and the
                                  hyperdimensional forms that are generally
                                  classified as teleportation and

AV         7/1/01   12:13 AM ...the first chapter segued into the second
                                  chapter, in which I had tapped my full
                                  potential and crossed another threshold into a
                                  very advanced very spiritual civilization
                                  which existed beyond, or between, life and
                                  death... and there I was heralded as this
                                  heroic, powerful, divine being... like night
                                  unto God... and... I was sort of stunned... I
                                  sort of woke up and looked at them, after they
                                  had all calmed down a bit and I told them
                                  there was a mistake... it seemed pretty
                                  obvious they were offering me something akin
                                  to the throne... and it all felt so wrong... I
                                  protested, this was not who I was... I looked
                                  at them and said... "No... I am Phoenix..."
                                  and they all stopped and looked at me... as
                                  they watched, the illusions dropped away from
                                  me, allowing them to see the real me, and from
                                  their reaction I could tell that all that they
                                  had done before had been some test... they
                                  looked up at me with a mix  of joy and awe...
                                  as if they could not believe I would so
                                  casually reject the divine authority to simply
                                  hold on to my own sense of identity...

AV         7/1/01   12:18 AM the dream went on, but it was sort of, me
                                  settling into my own proper role... becoming a
                                  part of the day to day events... and, holding
                                  a position more akin to princess with
                                  prospects of becoming queen... and holding a
                                  place in the very hearts of my people, as
                                  opposed to the authority over people's minds
                                  that I had refused

AV         7/1/01   12:19 AM I realized that in my own way, I was more
                                  powerful, and more important to people in my
                                  proper role... but it was a quiet, calm and
                                  inspiring influence on the people... 

Kaori-Chan 7/1/01   12:20 AM that's very interesting... I am shocked that
                                  you remember so much of it.  ^>^  My dreams

                                  moments, but I can still feel the weight of
                                  years unfolding while I was in the dream...
                                  sort of like, trying to remember all the
                                  events of your childhood... you went through
                                  all those years, but  you only seem to be able
                                  to call up a few key moments

Kaori-Chan 7/1/01   12:24 AM perhaps your dreams are more than just dreams.

AV         7/1/01   12:25 AM I've considered that possability... I have had
                                  dreams that could inspire complete sagas! and,
                                  the ones that are that detailed always seem to
                                  tie me into the Phoenix, or set me up as the
                                  Goddess... that's what inluenced my writing,
                                  the civilization and culture and beliefs of
                                  the Avon

Kaori-Chan 7/1/01   12:27 AM perhaps you are accessing the spiritual
                                  portions of your mind, those things you
                                  practice in the dream, maybe you do them in
                                  your sleep... perhaps your soul visits
                                  different worlds through hyperspatial rifts
                                  created by such abilities.

AV         7/1/01   12:29 AM ::smiling:: it is a nice theory! I do know
                                  from many dreams that I understand precisely
                                  how to transformmyself... and I've had any
                                  number of dreams in which I've confronted my
                                  fears about such an ability... and dreams in
                                  which it was the only way to overcome false
                                  transformation and illusions designed to deny
                                  my true identity

Kaori-Chan 7/1/01   12:30 AM and you write all these dreams down as well as
                                  you can?

AV         7/1/01   12:30 AM my dream from last night I was in a situation
                                  where the people around me were "trying" to
                                  help me return to my proper body, but they
                                  betrayed me, sticking me in another body and
                                  giving mine to someone else... and neither of
                                  us was happy about it!

AV         7/1/01   12:31 AM um... no... not often

Kaori-Chan 7/1/01   12:31 AM aaah, and that's the second odd dream
                                  recently?

AV         7/1/01   12:32 AM yes... I knew who I was and where I belonged,
                                  and I had to finally assert my own power to
                                  straighten the mess out, but I got so worked
                                  up over it I woke myself up... I had a hard
                                  itme getting back to sleep and slept for
                                  another 8 hours without dreaming at all

Kaori-Chan 7/1/01   12:33 AM *Hugs you gently*

AV         7/1/01   12:34 AM ::smiles and squeezes tight::
                                  
                                  I am gonna split for a moment... there's still
                                  come cake left downstairs ::yum!::

Kaori-Chan 7/1/01   12:35 AM come cake? That would be a pretty odd cake.

AV         7/1/01   12:36 AM my birthday cake, from last night... ::rereads
                                  and blushes:: oh... oops... ah heh heh heh...
                                  I suppose that would be an acquired taste...
                                  ::licks her lips::

Kaori-Chan 7/1/01   12:36 AM *laughs* =)

Kaori-Chan 7/1/01   12:53 AM was the cake good?  =)

Kaori-Chan 7/1/01   1:01 AM  Aleeeex? are you there?

Kaori-Chan 7/1/01   1:21 AM  aleeex... I'm getting very tired.  *Sighs*

AV         7/1/01   1:35 AM  whoa. sorry... I took some cake in to Launce
                                  and got sucked into a debate...

Kaori-Chan 7/1/01   1:36 AM  Another couple minutes and I would be
                                  completely unconcious, as it was, I was laying
                                  down with my eyes closed.

AV         7/1/01   1:36 AM  I am sorry... ::holds out her hand to be
                                  slapped::
                                  
                                  do you need to go to bed now?

Kaori-Chan 7/1/01   1:38 AM  Why would I slap your hand? O.o
                                  
                                  *Sighs* I probably should, I am dreadfully
                                  tired.  Was up till three a.m. last night
                                  waiting to see if you got on.  ^>^

AV         7/1/01   1:39 AM  wow. I must have checked just after you got
                                  off then... well, I won't keep you up then...
                                  I am a bit tired myself ::yawns and stretches
                                  like a cat::

Kaori-Chan 7/1/01   1:40 AM  *Tickles your tummy as you stretch*

AV         7/1/01   1:40 AM  ::giggles and tries to cover up:: AAAaack!

                                  ::laughing::

Kaori-Chan 7/1/01   1:41 AM  *Smiles and gently takes you into his arms,
                                  kissing your silken soft lips for a long
                                  moment*

                                  himself* I love you, Alex.... I can't explain
                                  how much.

AV         7/1/01   1:43 AM  I know the feeling! ::curls your long hair
                                  around her finger, looking at you lovingly::

Kaori-Chan 7/1/01   1:44 AM  *Smiles, kissing your lips a couple times,
                                  arms draped around your hips* Someday, I'm
                                  going to kiss you all over.

                                  breasts, sighing..* Sweet dreams, Alex....

                                  entangled with yours.*

AV         7/1/01   1:49 AM  nnnnnnnnn! I can practically feel that!...

Kaori-Chan 7/1/01   1:50 AM  *Sits up on the bed, looking at you carefully
                                  for a moment.*

Kaori-Chan 7/1/01   1:52 AM  *A hand drifts up, almost hesitantly.. so very
                                  softly brushing the smoothness of your
                                  cheek... gently playing across your bangs
                                  before tucking a lock of hair behind your ear,

Kaori-Chan 7/1/01   2:06 AM  just enough for you to feel them on your skin
                                  but no more than that.... caressing the divine
                                  swellings of your milky white bosom... tracing

                                  that happen... I agree, let's wait until we
                                  are both able to do it justice... you do need
                                  your sleep, and I need to stop looking at this
                                  screen before it gives me a headache!

                                  too hot even in the shade!

AV         7/1/01   5:00 PM  I tried to be up at 1, but I had trouble
                                  sleeping last night... I would sleep for a
                                  half hour and then wake up and struggle to get
                                  back to sleep... until around 10... then I
                                  ended up sleeping until 2! 

Kaori-Chan 7/1/01   5:01 PM  *hugs* Bad dreams?

AV         7/1/01   5:02 PM  um... no... just normal dreams... but I had
                                  cheese burgers for dinner the night before and
                                  ended up with heartburn that would not go
                                  away...

Kaori-Chan 7/1/01   5:03 PM  Agh!!!
                                  
                                  
                                  Why didn't you drink some milk? Milk is a
                                  natural stomach calmer.

AV         7/1/01   5:04 PM  maybe for most people, but it causes mucus
                                  build up that makes it hard to breathe when I
                                  am asleep

Kaori-Chan 7/1/01   5:04 PM  oh.... =\
                                  
                                  

AV         7/1/01   5:07 PM  yeah... life is full of these annoying little
                                  problems... and if I have a mcdonalds quarter
                                  pounder with cheese, I will have the worst
                                  problems sleeping of all... the onions and
                                  cheese cause a combination of dehydration and
                                  mucus build up which can cause me to stop
                                  breathing and in some cases to even
                                  hallucinate... and, of course that's my
                                  favorite fast food!

AV         7/1/01   5:07 PM  I've since realized that I am allergic to raw
                                  onions, or something in the processed cheese

Kaori-Chan 7/1/01   5:08 PM  Hmm.... can't you fix that sort of thing when
                                  you change? ^^;

AV         7/1/01   5:08 PM  I don't see why not...

Kaori-Chan 7/1/01   5:09 PM  heehee... cheeseburgers for you when you're
                                  you.  =)

AV         7/1/01   5:09 PM  ::laughing::

Kaori-Chan 7/1/01   5:11 PM  *shifts, carefully moving closer to you,
                                  smiling softly as he drapes his arms around
                                  your hips*
                                  
                                  God, I love you Alex.

AV         7/1/01   5:12 PM  ::looks at you:: well, don't hate me now...
                                  I'm being dragged away by Launce... we're both
                                  on the verge of heat exhaustion, and in
                                  desperate need of iced coffee and a nice air
                                  conditioned place to sit down...

AV         7/1/01   5:13 PM  ::traces her fingers over your face::

Kaori-Chan 7/1/01   5:13 PM  *Kisses you gently* Go, m'love...  but come
                                  back to me soon.

AV         7/1/01   5:14 PM  I'll see what I can do, but if it stays this
                                  hot, I might be too brain dead to chat until
                                  the sun goes down... ::kisses you gently on
                                  the lips::

Kaori-Chan 7/1/01   5:16 PM  Buy lots of ice.  =)  *Returns that kiss with
                                  love*

AV         7/1/01   5:17 PM  I will... well, I am going now... talk to you
                                  later, Love

AV         7/1/01   11:14 PM I've been a bad girl... I've been avoiding you
                                  tonight...

Kaori-Chan 7/1/01   11:14 PM why?  =(  is something wrong?

AV         7/1/01   11:14 PM just me... I've been in an off mood... 

AV         7/1/01   11:15 PM I always want to give you my best, and I just
                                  was not up to my best tonight...

Kaori-Chan 7/1/01   11:15 PM you aren't upset at me, or something I said or
                                  something I might do, are you?

AV         7/1/01   11:16 PM no... if I had a problem with you, I would
                                  tell you...

Kaori-Chan 7/1/01   11:17 PM then why avoid me, dearest??? If you have to
                                  deal with my bad self, I should be able to
                                  deal with yours.

AV         7/1/01   11:18 PM well... it's not so much that I want to avoid
                                  you in particular... as much as I want to
                                  avoid the frustration of only being with you
                                  in words... 

Kaori-Chan 7/1/01   11:19 PM oh... I am sorry, Darling.  *Hugs you tightly*

AV         7/1/01   11:20 PM ::slips her arms around you::
                                  
                                  it just serves as one more reminder of the
                                  state I am in and how it isolates me from the
                                  people I care about... I hate it

Kaori-Chan 7/1/01   11:21 PM But I like talking to you, Alex.  I like
                                  discussing with you, I enjoy it more than with
                                  anyone else.

AV         7/1/01   11:22 PM I am sure you do! ::laughing:: and I don't
                                  begrudge you that... honestly I don't... 

Kaori-Chan 7/1/01   11:23 PM I know... it's hard to wait for the change and
                                  be with me.

AV         7/1/01   11:24 PM ::nods::
                                  ::looks at you::
                                  can I ask you some very personal questions?

Kaori-Chan 7/1/01   11:26 PM always, Alex.

AV         7/1/01   11:26 PM okay... um... okay, first, are you a virgin?

Kaori-Chan 7/1/01   11:26 PM no.
                                  
                                  Have had sex twice.  Didn't finish the second
                                  session.

AV         7/1/01   11:31 PM ::nods and pats your hand::
                                  if you want, some time, maybe we can talk
                                  about those two times... I won't press you
                                  about the details now though...
                                  as a girl I am a virgin... 
                                  my expereinces gave me a unique perspective on
                                  sex... as a boy, I had this incredible insight
                                  into how girls worked and what they wanted,
                                  and how to please them... the reverse is true
                                  too... having lived in a male body, I know how
                                  it ticks, what really turns a guy on and how
                                  to give him intense pleasure... since you
                                  experienced that duality... so you feel that
                                  you have this advantage in some part?

AV         7/1/01   11:32 PM so = do

Kaori-Chan 7/1/01   11:33 PM I like taking care to make the woman feel
                                  good, it is something I am concerned with,
                                  unlike most men.
                                  
                                  To be honest, Alex, I've been fantasizing
                                  about the girl I did it with the second time,
                                  and wondering if I got another opportunity.. I
                                  wanted to tell you this to see how you felt
                                  about it.

AV         7/1/01   11:38 PM I understand, believe me... I am a very sexual
                                  being... your own personal sex goddess if you
                                  will! I don't have any problems with friendly
                                  fornication, sexual fantasies, sexual
                                  experimentation, or even sexual adventurism...
                                  as long as care is taken to ensure that no one
                                  gets hurt
                                  
                                  not only am I happy to talk about it, I will
                                  say this... if you get that opportunity, I
                                  suggest you go for it... only, don't fall in
                                  love with her if she cannot stand the fact
                                  that you love me, and hopefully don't intend
                                  to stop... if she does fall in love with
                                  you... well, then I would have to try to win
                                  her love too to keep her from eventually
                                  hating me

Kaori-Chan 7/1/01   11:38 PM She's a rather good girl, very warm hearted...
                                  problem is, she does have a thing for me and
                                  has for years.

AV         7/1/01   11:39 PM however... if you can't stand the idea of me
                                  having lovers, I would not recommend you going
                                  out and having lovers of your own... I don't
                                  need, or necessarily want them... but, I am
                                  something of a nymphomaniac... if the
                                  opportunity presents itself, and no one will
                                  get hurt, I will happily go play

AV         7/1/01   11:39 PM um... I don't see any problem with that,
                                  unless you don't particularily care for her...

AV         7/1/01   11:40 PM or if you think she might get possessive... 

Kaori-Chan 7/1/01   11:40 PM I don't mind.  When we're together, I doubt
                                  I'll WANT anyone else...

AV         7/1/01   11:40 PM ::grins::

AV         7/1/01   11:41 PM I fear I am liable to have that efect on any
                                  man

AV         7/1/01   11:41 PM effect

Kaori-Chan 7/1/01   11:41 PM =)

AV         7/1/01   11:42 PM so, obviously, it does concern me a great
                                  deal... men will cheerfully fuck a girl and
                                  dump her... but if you expect that to happen
                                  you'll end up getting the opposite reaction!

Kaori-Chan 7/1/01   11:43 PM what do you mean?

AV         7/1/01   11:43 PM he'll get possessive and jealous and
                                  competetive... and... I never want to get you
                                  into the middle of something like that

AV         7/1/01   11:44 PM you, darling, change everything...

AV         7/1/01   11:44 PM I have to be careful or my naught little ways
                                  will cause problems

AV         7/1/01   11:44 PM naughty

AV         7/1/01   11:45 PM ::sigh::

Kaori-Chan 7/1/01   11:45 PM *Hugs you tightly* lets both be careful in
                                  what we do.

AV         7/1/01   11:45 PM yes... indeed!

Kaori-Chan 7/1/01   11:47 PM do you believe in "Fuck buddies"?
                                  
                                  It's a nineties thing, people having sex with
                                  friends but not committing to romantic
                                  relationships.

AV         7/1/01   11:47 PM for now, you are free to do as you please...
                                  once we are together, we have to confront
                                  these things as a couple... our prospective
                                  partners will have to deal with us as a
                                  couple... if they agree to play by those
                                  rules, then... hopefully no one will get hurt

AV         7/1/01   11:47 PM yes... I suppose I do

Kaori-Chan 7/1/01   11:47 PM okay.  Well, I'll have to talk to the girl and
                                  she if she consents to that sort of
                                  relationship.

AV         7/1/01   11:48 PM sex is not bad or evil or anything to be
                                  ashamed of... it's fun, and healthy... and
                                  great exercise!  

Kaori-Chan 7/1/01   11:49 PM *laughs* okay.

AV         7/1/01   11:49 PM for me, I don't intend to get pregnant by
                                  accident... it won't be necessary for me to be
                                  that vulnerable... and that, pregnancy... is
                                  the root of sexual competetion

AV         7/1/01   11:50 PM um... of course, I do urge safe sex... 

AV         7/1/01   11:51 PM if you're both healthy, that simply means,
                                  don't knock her up if that's not your
                                  intention... but, do not risk getting any
                                  diseases, alright?

Kaori-Chan 7/1/01   11:51 PM *Nods* I understand.

AV         7/1/01   11:52 PM if you're both clean, and take precautions to
                                  deal with the pregnancy issue... then, I'm
                                  fine with unprotected sex... it's really the
                                  only way to enjoy it
                                  ::devilish grin::

Kaori-Chan 7/1/01   11:54 PM *laughs* Hai, hai... the only big problem is a
                                  girl can get pregnant at any time, according
                                  to recent knowledge... it's just more frequent
                                  closer to her period.

AV         7/1/01   11:55 PM I know... but, a sponge with spermicide, use
                                  in conjunction with the pill is about as safe
                                  as a condom... which is only about 99% safe

AV         7/1/01   11:55 PM or a diaphragm with spermicide gel

AV         7/1/01   11:56 PM combined with the pill, or depoprovera

Kaori-Chan 7/1/01   11:56 PM *Nod nods* okay.  ^^;

AV         7/1/01   11:57 PM still, never see a girl without a supply of
                                  condoms... if she has a double blind
                                  protection and says you don't need them, cool,
                                  but never, never, see a girl without them

AV         7/1/01   11:58 PM that's just common courtesy

Kaori-Chan 7/2/01   12:02 AM *Nod nods* Kay.  ^>^

AV         7/2/01   12:02 AM I'll be totally honest... sex with a condom is
                                  effort expended for the girl's benefit... I
                                  recommend it if you want to send her into
                                  triple O territority... but you have to follow
                                  it up with a pelvic bath... to get rid of the
                                  spermicide most condoms are soaked in... and
                                  then a good blow job... so the poor guy gets
                                  something worthwhile out of it! ::giggling::

AV         7/2/01   12:04 AM even those ultra thin condoms totally mask the
                                  friction of intercourse for a guy... takes the
                                  best part of it and wipes it out! ::sigh::

Kaori-Chan 7/2/01   12:04 AM I am quite aware of that.  ^>^
                                  
                                  And I don't think Danita is the cocksucking
                                  type.

AV         7/2/01   12:07 AM what a shame... there's really nothing quite
                                  like it... she's missing out
                                  (of couse that might be pride speaking... I do
                                  give the best blow jobs, if I do say so myself
                                  ::burnishing her fingernails on her shirt::)

AV         7/2/01   12:09 AM ::blink blink::

Kaori-Chan 7/2/01   12:09 AM You've.. uhm, given blowjobs before? ^>^

AV         7/2/01   12:15 AM well... yes... I... um... sort of learned how
                                  on myself... and, well... let's just say I
                                  found girls fun in bed, but I was always
                                  attracted to men... and it was the only thing
                                  I really had to offer... some guy would press
                                  my buttons, and I'd just melt into putty...
                                  and if I didn't keep it oral... it would... go
                                  in a direction I couldn't really deal with...
                                  I was a... straight girl, for the most part,
                                  stuck in a boy's body

AV         7/2/01   12:16 AM I could make a girl REALLY happy, but for me
                                  it was... rather painful... and, there are
                                  guys who are attracted to the TS girl... who
                                  treated me like a girl... and of course gay
                                  men who were as painful to sleep with as
                                  straight girls

Kaori-Chan 7/2/01   12:17 AM aah... *Hugs you tight* It's okay hon, I
                                  understand.

AV         7/2/01   12:17 AM you have to understand though... these were a
                                  few isolated relationships spread out over
                                  several years... I haven't been in a
                                  relationship in about... five years

Kaori-Chan 7/2/01   12:18 AM I understand hon, I love you.  *hugs you* Just
                                  chalk it up to learning for me.  =)

AV         7/2/01   12:18 AM ::nods, and hugs you back:: alright... 

AV         7/2/01   12:20 AM now... did it bother you, for even a monent?

AV         7/2/01   12:20 AM moment

AV         7/2/01   12:20 AM grrr

AV         7/2/01   12:20 AM sorry, I have this morbid desire to know what
                                  was going through your head at that point!
                                  ::soft giggle::

Kaori-Chan 7/2/01   12:21 AM no, not really... I'm not sure what you're
                                  asking about though.

AV         7/2/01   12:21 AM hmmm... I was just wondering what you were
                                  thinking when you asked me if I had given blow
                                  jobs before...

Kaori-Chan 7/2/01   12:23 AM I was thinking of a beautiful redhead sucking
                                  me off.

AV         7/2/01   12:23 AM did you feel... surprised... excited... a
                                  little jealous, maybe? did you imagine for a
                                  moment what it would be like...?

AV         7/2/01   12:23 AM ah ha! ::smiling happily::

AV         7/2/01   12:26 AM well... I do hope you won't be upset if I
                                  fondling you or sucking on you... I do have
                                  a... an appetite for manhood, so to speak...
                                  any time, anywhere... 

AV         7/2/01   12:27 AM oh... dropped out a few words... I meant... if
                                  I devote a lot of time to...

AV         7/2/01   12:27 AM not so much, for hours on end, as with unusual
                                  frequency...

AV         7/2/01   12:28 AM like... whenever I can get you in private and
                                  with your pants down! ::laughing::

Kaori-Chan 7/2/01   12:29 AM *Smiles*  It's okay hon, I won't mind... =)

AV         7/2/01   12:33 AM wonderful! 
                                  
                                  I have to confess... as much as it always
                                  irked me to have one ::rolling her eyes:: I
                                  HAVE gotten used to having one handy whenever
                                  I wanted to play with one... oh, god, the
                                  conquences of that!  I suppose I am lucky I am
                                  not as flexible as I was as a teen! 

Kaori-Chan 7/2/01   12:33 AM ^^;;;
                                  
                                  Well, you want to get rid of it I thought...
                                  and be a woman?

AV         7/2/01   12:39 AM yes... absolutely... I have to actually devote
                                  a great deal of energy to suppressing the urge
                                  to cut it off... and a few times I almost did
                                  not succeed!  but I do find penises very
                                  attractive, I love to touch and explore
                                  them... it's like the usual sex transfomration
                                  joke... a guy turns into a girl and can't
                                  resist fondling his own breasts... it's really
                                  the cruelest joke! if I give in to the
                                  temptation to touch it, I also have to feel it
                                  as a part of me, which drives me a bit
                                  insane... a terrifying mix of physical
                                  pleasure and spiritual agony... I habitually
                                  tied a string or something around my genitals,
                                  to make them go numb, so I didn't have to feel
                                  it except with my hands...

Kaori-Chan 7/2/01   12:40 AM =\ *Hugs you close*

AV         7/2/01   12:42 AM for me, having a penis is simply having a
                                  dangerously tempting way to commit suicide...
                                  whenever I notice it, I want to cut it off...
                                  and, if I do, I bleed to death... and you
                                  can't do to a doctor and ask them to do it...
                                  they just lecture you that you need to keep it
                                  because they use it in a sex change... and if
                                  you do cut it off and end up in a hospital,
                                  they just sew the damn thing back on!!! can
                                  you believe that!  
                                  
                                  I actually did end up in an emergency room
                                  because of this, last January

Kaori-Chan 7/2/01   12:43 AM O.O
                                  
                                  what happened?

AV         7/2/01   12:49 AM I had wrapped an elastic hair tie around my
                                  genitals, triple twisted... it cut off the
                                  circulation very fast, and I realized it was
                                  on too tight... I was already half tempted to
                                  cut it off.. I was pretty near the end of my
                                  rope...
                                  
                                  I told the doctors who treated me that I tried
                                  to cut the tie and accidentally cut into
                                  myself, but I'll tell you... I was mad... I
                                  deliberately tried to castrate myself... once
                                  I realized how well I'd cut off the
                                  circulation... but... as I was cutting... I
                                  discoverd the knife I had was not sharp
                                  enough... if it had been, I'd be emasculated
                                  right now... instead, I stopped, and tried to
                                  go to sleep... I figured... if I leave it tied
                                  like this over night, the tissue will die off
                                  due to strangulation... it's how they castrate
                                  livestock... after a few days, the
                                  constriction area seals itself off and the
                                  dead tissue just falls off... I had no idea
                                  how painful it would be though... cutting my
                                  scrotum was nothing... but the nerves to my
                                  testicles sent the pain shooting through my
                                  abdomen... it gave me second thoughts... I
                                  thought I could stand the pain, even if it
                                  lasted a few days, but I suddenly began to
                                  worry that there was still some circulation,
                                  which meant I could get gangrene... I finally
                                  went into the emergency room...

Kaori-Chan 7/2/01   12:52 AM did you do any lasting damage?

AV         7/2/01   12:54 AM to my surprise, the four hours I had cut off
                                  circulation was not enough to kill the
                                  organ... once they had the urologist's
                                  opinion, they cut the hair tie off and the
                                  circulation came back... fire and ice... but
                                  the pain in my adomen went away... they sewed
                                  up the cut and sent me on my way... there was
                                  lasting nerve damage... enough that I can't
                                  tell I have a penis anymore... just a fog of
                                  sensation... I can feel heat, cold, pressure,
                                  friction, pain and pleasure, but not the
                                  kinesthetic sense of a penis... there's not
                                  enough resolution... sensation without form...
                                  so, now, I don't have that direct connecion to
                                  it... I can touch it, and it's just like
                                  touching another man's penis... and the
                                  sensation I feel is... detached... with
                                  clothes on, I feel only the smoothe curve of
                                  the pubic arch and something like outer
                                  labia... and a sensitive area like a
                                  clitoris... it left my genitals feeling
                                  female, from within...

AV         7/2/01   12:55 AM sometimes it's like having a sock stuffed down
                                  my underwear... 

AV         7/2/01   12:56 AM I can tell there is an object occupying space
                                  but, not as a part of my body

AV         7/2/01   12:57 AM it does increast the temptation to cut it off
                                  sometimes, because I know that the pain of the
                                  cutting will be even less noticible than
                                  before... but the bleeding problem remains...
                                  I don't want to die... I don't even want to
                                  cut it off, really... in a way that seems like
                                  a crime against manhood... I wouldn't dare
                                  think such thoughts about another man's
                                  penis...

AV         7/2/01   12:58 AM my only hope it to transform...

AV         7/2/01   12:58 AM is

Kaori-Chan 7/2/01   12:58 AM *Nod nods*
                                  
                                  =\
                                  
                                  Well... what about the change?  Have you
                                  gotten any closer?

AV         7/2/01   12:58 AM ::sighs and shakes her head::

Kaori-Chan 7/2/01   12:59 AM I am hurting for you....  I want you to be
                                  happy, to be you.
                                  
                                  

AV         7/2/01   12:59 AM me too

Kaori-Chan 7/2/01   12:59 AM I know that it can be done... I just wish you
                                  could do it, I don't know what keeps stopping
                                  you.  What is keeping you from changing, I
                                  mean.

AV         7/2/01   1:00 AM  I can feel the capicity within myself... it is
                                  there... but it's still locked or or blocked
                                  somehow... I often get the feeling that it
                                  just isn't the right time... like I am waiting
                                  for something, unconsciously

Kaori-Chan 7/2/01   1:01 AM  what if it doesn't happen for years?

AV         7/2/01   1:07 AM  not a fun question....

Kaori-Chan 7/2/01   1:07 AM  no, a very painful question.

AV         7/2/01   1:07 AM  I don't have the endurance left for years...

AV         7/2/01   1:07 AM  if not for you... I don't know if I'd still be
                                  here today

Kaori-Chan 7/2/01   1:08 AM  Were you... giving up when you met me?

AV         7/2/01   1:08 AM  do you remember the conversation on your
                                  birthday, how it started?

Kaori-Chan 7/2/01   1:09 AM  no, apologies...

AV         7/2/01   1:11 AM  I had already given up everything in my
                                  life... I was gearing up to focus all of my
                                  energy on transformation... holding nothing
                                  back... I would either suceed or die... I was
                                  ready to give it my all... it was no longer
                                  about succeeding, but doing all I possibly
                                  could... I would have been content to die for
                                  my belief in myself... 

AV         7/2/01   1:12 AM  finding you was really the first indication I
                                  ever got that there was a place for me in this
                                  world

Kaori-Chan 7/2/01   1:12 AM  perhaps that is what you needed, Alex...
                                  perhaps I have held you back.
                                  
                                  In these things a person must commit their
                                  very soul...

AV         7/2/01   1:14 AM  I have always known who I am... even when I
                                  could not describe it... and that I had to
                                  manifest my true self... I knew why I needed
                                  to, which was for me... but I never knew what
                                  to do once I had manifested... you provided
                                  that answer

AV         7/2/01   1:14 AM  fiding you also helped me understand a lot of
                                  things about myself that always confused me
                                  and tied me up

AV         7/2/01   1:15 AM  it still amazes me how deep we are into each
                                  other... how deeply connected we are...

Kaori-Chan 7/2/01   1:15 AM  Alex... to truly change you must sacrifice
                                  everything.... don't ask me how I know that...
                                  it is just the way of Magick.
                                  
                                  You must be willing to give it all up,
                                  regardless of my presence.

AV         7/2/01   1:16 AM  I know you don't think you're very impressive,
                                  but you are the man of my dreams, the man I
                                  have looked for, the man I tried to be... you
                                  are a part of me, and thus, you are a part of
                                  my transformation...

AV         7/2/01   1:16 AM  you are a part of my life, a part of what I
                                  risk

AV         7/2/01   1:17 AM  if I die, I don't doubt it will kill you too

Kaori-Chan 7/2/01   1:17 AM  I am also a part of what is holding you back,
                                  I am a threat of keeping you as you are.  Do
                                  you understand why?

AV         7/2/01   1:17 AM  if you never heard from me again, it would eat
                                  at you and eat at you.. until it drove you
                                  over the edge

AV         7/2/01   1:18 AM  is that enough of an answer?

Kaori-Chan 7/2/01   1:18 AM  it is an answer, but this isn't about me.  I
                                  am just the love of your life, this is about
                                  you... and who you must be, who you must
                                  become.. how you must change.

AV         7/2/01   1:19 AM  it's one thing to gamble with my own life...
                                  it's quite another to gamble with yours

Kaori-Chan 7/2/01   1:21 AM  that's why it's called gambling, you can't win
                                  without risking something...
                                  
                                  you're willing to give your life, but not
                                  anothers.

AV         7/2/01   1:22 AM  I understand

AV         7/2/01   1:24 AM  if I do this, I risk hurting people... if I
                                  don't do this, I risk hurting people...

AV         7/2/01   1:25 AM  without intentind to, the consequences of my
                                  actions can cause people pain and suffering...
                                  even if my action is to do nothing

Kaori-Chan 7/2/01   1:25 AM  That is correct...
                                  
                                  it is the lesson all Keepers must learn, or
                                  the Artifae will not accept them.
                                  
                                  It is also a painful thing to consider.
                                  
                                  Know that I love you, despite whatever you may
                                  do.

Kaori-Chan 7/2/01   1:26 AM  The only way for evil to triumph is for good
                                  men to do nothing...
                                  
                                  Inaction is the worst crime that can be made.

AV         7/2/01   1:27 AM  and if the only thing I can do puts me forever
                                  out of your reach? what then, my love?

Kaori-Chan 7/2/01   1:28 AM  then at least you will have tried.

                                  life

Kaori-Chan 7/2/01   1:35 AM  *nods* That's correct, Alex... However much it
                                  hurts me to say, I am the mouth of the Divine,
                                  his sword and his blade.

AV         7/2/01   1:35 AM  worse, I fear, if I don't fight free of
                                  everything around me, I will never be free to
                                  do what I must... that scares me... 

AV         7/2/01   1:40 AM  I need to go... I need to sleep...

AV         7/2/01   1:41 AM  I feel very old and tired all of a sudden

                                  suicide... this is about letting go, not dying

AV         7/2/01   1:48 AM  if life holds no solution, than life itself is
                                  a lie... an illusion, in which death holds no
                                  meaning... 

Kaori-Chan 7/2/01   1:48 AM  *nods*  But you stated the risk might be your
                                  life.

AV         7/2/01   1:50 AM  yes, as far as the world is concerned, I might
                                  die... but for me, life can only change it's
                                  form... death is merely change... a door way
                                  to rebirth... 

Kaori-Chan 7/2/01   1:51 AM  I will be here for you.. waiting for you,

Kaori-Chan 7/2/01   4:57 PM  yes?

AV         7/2/01   5:03 PM  dropping everything and hitting the road is no
                                  different than sitting down and emasculating
                                  myself... it's not hard at all to prove my
                                  level of commitment, but... the consequences
                                  are pretty obvious, either one will kill me
                                  
                                  confronting death in this way is... sort of
                                  redundant... I confront death every time I get
                                  in a car or walk across the street in
                                  traffic... I consciously look death in the
                                  eye, every day... 

Kaori-Chan 7/2/01   5:03 PM  you misunderstood me if you thought I said you
                                  must confront death... letting go can be an
                                  entirely different thing.

AV         7/2/01   5:14 PM  ::laughing:: there's always room for
                                  misunderstanding... but, no, I was not
                                  referring to anything you said as much as what
                                  sort of actions might be entailed in "letting
                                  go" and the outcome which is certain in such
                                  actions... what it comes down to is, my life
                                  has been a venture dedicated to "letting go"
                                  but being alive, I still had to deal with the
                                  kinds of situations and problems dictated by
                                  sharing the world with other people... today,
                                  letting go seems an almost impossible venture
                                  because I can't think of anything I'm really
                                  holding on to... and there is very little I
                                  can claim is really holding on to me... if I
                                  simply walked away, I would be forced to
                                  invest effort and energy into the walking...
                                  the situation I am in, I can expend the same
                                  energy on writing and, in that fashion acheive
                                  some mote of independance
                                  
                                  but, in either case, it does not change
                                  anything... what I need resides within... and
                                  it cannot be bluffed or provoked into
                                  blooming... I must be content with the fact
                                  that right not I am more rosebud than rose,
                                  and trust that the sun will rise and tease my
                                  petals open

AV         7/2/01   5:14 PM  right now

AV         7/2/01   5:14 PM  ::sighs, and shakes her errant fingers::

Kaori-Chan 7/2/01   5:20 PM  and what of years? Decades? Never?

AV         7/2/01   5:21 PM  isn't that the real adversary? isn't that the
                                  fear, the doubt, the uncertainty that proves
                                  the most painful to confront?

AV         7/2/01   5:21 PM  isn't that the real test?

Kaori-Chan 7/2/01   5:22 PM  *Sighs*

AV         7/2/01   5:23 PM  sigh, indeed

Kaori-Chan 7/2/01   5:24 PM  I am being selfish.

AV         7/2/01   5:25 PM  so am I ::laughing:: I absolutely hate the
                                  idea... it drives me mad... pushes me again
                                  and again to the brink of suicide... and, the
                                  simple truth is, I am... AM... confronting my
                                  greatest fear

AV         7/2/01   5:25 PM  I don't know how to overcome it... all I know
                                  is, I cannot fold in the face of it

AV         7/2/01   5:27 PM  I cannot be broken by it... 

Kaori-Chan 7/2/01   5:27 PM  I am sorry for wanting this for me... this is
                                  your battle, and would have taken place
                                  regardless of my presence.

AV         7/2/01   5:29 PM  yes... but, knowing you has helped me so
                                  much... loving you has, in one sense, set me
                                  free... I can imagine a future... I can think
                                  of a tomorrow... it used to be, I could think
                                  only of my manifestation, but I could hardly
                                  imagine what lay beyond it

AV         7/2/01   5:32 PM  well... I'm done with my email... I have to
                                  split again for a while

Kaori-Chan 7/2/01   5:32 PM  where are you going? =(

AV         7/2/01   5:33 PM  I don't know yet...

Kaori-Chan 7/2/01   5:34 PM  why are you going?

AV         7/2/01   5:36 PM  because there are too many distractions, and
                                  my nerves are a bit raw

Kaori-Chan 7/2/01   5:36 PM  I haven't gotten to talk to you hardly at all
                                  since you got your computer back.

AV         7/2/01   5:37 PM  which do you value more? quality or quanity?

Kaori-Chan 7/2/01   5:38 PM  time with you.

AV         7/2/01   5:39 PM  ::smiles and nods:: 
                                  can I ask you... do you normally have privacy
                                  when you spend long hours on the computer
                                  chatting with your friends? or are you
                                  frustrated by constant interruptions and
                                  distractions?

Kaori-Chan 7/2/01   5:42 PM  ahh.. I normally have privacy... is that the
                                  problem, Alex?

AV         7/2/01   5:44 PM  yes.... I have... gods, I can't remember the
                                  last time I really had any privacy in my
                                  life... if I ever really did... only in my own
                                  mind do I find peace and sanctuary it seems...
                                  it seems like, even if I go off into the woods
                                  to find a secluded place to think, someone or
                                  something will interfere

AV         7/2/01   5:46 PM  where I am now... there is not much privacy...
                                  I have to keep an eye and ear open for the
                                  girls... I also... am a guest in my friend's
                                  house 

Kaori-Chan 7/2/01   5:47 PM  *Nods, sighing*

AV         7/2/01   5:48 PM  at the moment a welcome and appreciated guest,
                                  and I don't want that to change... I was a
                                  very unwelcome guest in my brother's
                                  apartment... and from here, I really don't
                                  have anywhere to go
                                  
                                  I want to be able to enjoy your company... I
                                  really do... 

Kaori-Chan 7/2/01   5:50 PM  *Nods, hugging you tightly* It's alright,
                                  Alex.  I understand...  I wish it were
                                  different, but I understand.

AV         7/2/01   5:55 PM  I often wish things were different... and I
                                  believe you can find ice water in hell... I'm
                                  gonna split now...
                                  
                                  I'll leave my computer on and leave the chat
                                  window open... I'll pop in and out... but I
                                  can't sit here and have an involved
                                  conversation right now... maybe that'll change
                                  in an hour, maybe not... 
                                  
                                  if you have any thoughts you want to share,
                                  just toss 'em at me... I'll happily check in
                                  from time to time and say what I can...
                                  also... I sent you my stories so I *could* be
                                  with you when I was gone... I have lots of
                                  stuff written down, and I'd be happy to give
                                  you more to read for times when I am not
                                  available... I know it's not much, but it is
                                  me... my thoughts, my words, my feelings...
                                  it's as much as you've had of my here

Kaori-Chan 7/2/01   5:56 PM  *Nods, sighing* You go, do something to ease
                                  your nerves.

AV         7/2/01   5:56 PM  I'll be somewhere nearby... I'm on a cable
                                  modem now... I can stay connected to you as
                                  long as you want... ::she leans over and
                                  kisses you sensuously, sucking on your lower
                                  lip::

AV         7/2/01   5:57 PM  thank you... ::smile::

Kaori-Chan 7/2/01   6:02 PM  you should go to a library for quiet, beloved.

AV         7/2/01   6:04 PM  if I could survive the two mile walk to the
                                  nearest one in this heat! ::laughing::

Kaori-Chan 7/2/01   6:05 PM  only two miles?
                                  
                                  Hon, I live at least seven miles from any city
                                  sort of buildings.
                                  In fact, it's about half a mile to the end of
                                  Bradway road, where it meets Badger.
                                  
                                  
                                  Bikes are often a big help too.

AV         7/2/01   6:06 PM  would you enjoy that walk (or ride) in 109
                                  degree heat?

Kaori-Chan 7/2/01   6:07 PM  when you're moving on a bike, the wind feels
                                  somewhat nice.
                                  
                                  You need a self-cooling parasol.

AV         7/2/01   6:07 PM  if not for the heat, I'd just go across the
                                  street to the park and relax there...

Kaori-Chan 7/2/01   6:41 PM  Alex, I wanted to ask you something.

AV         7/2/01   6:58 PM  okay, I'm listening

Kaori-Chan 7/2/01   6:58 PM  well, first, what all are you writing at
                                  current?

AV         7/2/01   7:01 PM  um... actually, I'm kicking over an idea for a
                                  romance novel... Launce has that contact at
                                  Harliquin... at 4,000 a book, and about 200
                                  pages per, I could turn out one or two a
                                  month... aside from that, I have been working
                                  on how to fully integrate the psionics story
                                  into the revised universe and thus, be able to
                                  finish writing it... I have a full synopsis of
                                  that story, and a counter plot that I can work
                                  into it as well... but, right at this moment I
                                  am not actually writing anything

Kaori-Chan 7/2/01   7:02 PM  ah...
                                  
                                  Well, I would not want to take up any of your
                                  time, since you sound like you'll be busy soon
                                  enough writing many other things.

AV         7/2/01   7:14 PM  um... I'm not commiting to anything at the
                                  moment... I have some money saved, I don't
                                  need to decide right now... the romance novel
                                  thing is probably the most likely since there
                                  is some chance I could get published and start
                                  making money... it's not as demanding as my
                                  magnum opus... what did you have in mind to
                                  ask me?

Kaori-Chan 7/2/01   7:32 PM  I was wondering if you might be interested in
                                  a specifically Kaehmi sidestory for Fragile
                                  Clay? I've been wanting someone to do it, but
                                  the person who expressed interest won't likely
                                  ever get around to it.

AV         7/2/01   7:35 PM  that's Hiroshi's neice, right? that might be
                                  interesting... unless it's a major, long or in
                                  depth feature, I could probably fit it in in
                                  the next month... I'd be happy to talk it over
                                  and think about it... if we can agree on a
                                  story and idea I think it would be fun! I
                                  really like Kaehim...
                                  
                                  

Kaori-Chan 7/2/01   7:41 PM  Kaehmi, and yes, that's Hiroshi's niece.  ^>^
                                  
                                  The time period I was thinking about was
                                  either prior to Hiroshi's leaving, or the day
                                  after...
                                  
                                  was thinking about a name, FC: Red Ribbons...
                                  though I don't know why i would call it that.

Kaori-Chan 7/2/01   8:17 PM  Alex?? =\

AV         7/2/01   8:20 PM  sorry... I got dragged away to make dinner and
                                  now... I am going to take some time to sit
                                  down and eat...

AV         7/2/01   8:21 PM  I can chat a bit while I eat... you are there,
                                  right?

Kaori-Chan 7/2/01   8:21 PM  alright.
                                  
                                  What do you think of the title, though?  Any
                                  ideas? I'm mulling it over myself.

AV         7/2/01   8:24 PM  It wouldn't be hard to make the title relevant
                                  to the story... the night that Hiroshi left
                                  was a big day... the night of the prom...
                                  Kaehmi could well have gotten a bit caught up
                                  in the preparations, imagining her own future
                                  prom, and finding these beautiful red ribbons
                                  that flattered her and made her feel a bit
                                  more grown up... and, her getting all dressed
                                  up and waiting up for Hiroshi to come home to
                                  show him and Ranma... and neither of them ever
                                  showing up...

Kaori-Chan 7/2/01   8:25 PM  I was thinking, myself, about the Red Ribbons
                                  also being an important goal of the story...
                                  and that perhaps she notices ranma's
                                  unhappiness, giving her the ribbon... of
                                  course, this would have to assume that Ranma
                                  knew the value of the ribbon.

Kaori-Chan 7/2/01   8:25 PM  or ribbons.

AV         7/2/01   8:26 PM  explain that... what is the value of the
                                  ribbons?

Kaori-Chan 7/2/01   8:28 PM  well, assuming you used your storyline,
                                  perhaps Kaehmi would have to go on a small
                                  personal quest for the perfect ribbon or
                                  such... or perhaps she thinks red ribbons are
                                  special somehow.

AV         7/2/01   8:30 PM  okay... so you didn't have something integral
                                  to the story already in mind... I thought
                                  perhaps they might be some family heirloom...
                                  not the specific ribbon, perhaps, but the
                                  wearing of a particular type and color of
                                  ribbon in a particular way might be some
                                  family tradition... like a promise or a
                                  betrothal... or as a part of the family
                                  school, a measure of a particular status or
                                  honor

Kaori-Chan 7/2/01   8:31 PM  Let's not get past a little girl, now.  ^^;
                                  
                                  It's a little girls story.  You know what I
                                  mean?

AV         7/2/01   8:31 PM  or even, that the ribbon was a symbol of a
                                  girl's honor, and how it was worn, or treated
                                  a measure of display of the girl's honor,
                                  status and... affections

AV         7/2/01   8:32 PM  that's an odd statement... 

Kaori-Chan 7/2/01   8:32 PM  Children, hon, children don't worry about such
                                  things... except maybe little boys (The whole
                                  toughness thing and all).
                                  
                                  I don't know if little girls are concerned
                                  with those kind of things, remember, Kaehmi is
                                  only six years old.

AV         7/2/01   8:34 PM  the moment a little girl is given a dall to
                                  play with, she begins to think about these
                                  things... it's a part of all their childhood
                                  play, a life long preparation for becoming a
                                  wife and mother, the... traditionally... only
                                  respectible ambition for a girl in a
                                  patriarchial society

Kaori-Chan 7/2/01   8:35 PM  the person who was going to write it before
                                  was the mother of.. I think it was six
                                  children.  ^>^  She said my portrayal of
                                  little girls was one of the most accurate, and
                                  that if a story was going to be written with
                                  Kaehmi as star, it would have to keep the same
                                  level of simplicity.
                                  
                                  

AV         7/2/01   8:35 PM  admittedly, there are efforts in almost every
                                  society to keep girls ignorant about sex, in
                                  particular, but... most girls suffer fondling,
                                  molestation and in some cases rape before they
                                  reach menarche

                                  but, they are aware of them, and have a sense
                                  of the significance of such traditions that
                                  effects their actions...

Kaori-Chan 7/2/01   8:40 PM  I would think, remembering how I was as a
                                  child, and how other little girls acted....
                                  
                                  that the ribbons would be important because of
                                  being hard to find... it is like the principle
                                  of seashells, or multicolored rocks, pretty
                                  things.

AV         7/2/01   8:41 PM  or, if not hard to find, reserved for special
                                  occasions... like a party dress, or a
                                  costume...

AV         7/2/01   8:41 PM  and, with children, as a matter of fad
                                  fashion...

Kaori-Chan 7/2/01   8:42 PM  which are pretty... simply because we are
                                  adults, everything doesn't have to be complex.

AV         7/2/01   8:43 PM  I don't make things complex, things are
                                  complex enough on their own, I simply notice
                                  it more... as a writer, you have to deal with
                                  the world, as well as the character... the
                                  wonder of children is that they are
                                  refreshingly direct and uncomplicated living
                                  in a very complicated world

Kaori-Chan 7/2/01   8:44 PM  yes, direct and uncomplicated.
                                  
                                  *Sighs* Maybe this is a bad idea.

AV         7/2/01   8:45 PM  ::shrugs:: I don't see how... what's wrong?

Kaori-Chan 7/2/01   8:46 PM  It's... not that complex.  She wouldn't think
                                  about the complexities of honor and society,
                                  it wouldn't enter into her mind.  She wouldn't
                                  be thinking about status or fashion or fads...
                                  
                                  

AV         7/2/01   8:49 PM  I'm just starting from an established
                                  precedent... Hiroshi and his sister both come
                                  across as exceptionally perceptive people,
                                  unusually mature and intelligent... that to
                                  me, suggests that Kaehmi likely shares some of
                                  those traits... perhaps in a lesser way, or
                                  perhaps in a greater way... I am only trying
                                  to account for that possability...
                                  
                                  most of all, I do not believe in, nor do I
                                  encourage underestimating children... children
                                  are more alert, more perceptive and more
                                  intuitive than adults... they learn far faster
                                  and far more naturally than adults do... a
                                  child might not fully understand the world
                                  around them, but that's mostly do to lack of
                                  experience, not lack of intelligence or
                                  thought...

Kaori-Chan 7/2/01   8:51 PM  I can remember the kind of things I was
                                  concerned about... but that's as a boy.
                                  
                                  I'm not underestimating children.  Kaehmi
                                  herself is a good child, but look at her
                                  portrayal thus far... I hope you do not think
                                  that somehow Memeko's Martial Arts training
                                  influences the way her daughter thinks?

AV         7/2/01   8:52 PM  ::laughing:: from what I've seen of Memeko, it
                                  seems she lives by her philosophy, so how
                                  could it not?

Kaori-Chan 7/2/01   8:56 PM  Yes, from what you've seen of Memeko, she is
                                  surprisingly Kasumi-like despite what you SEE
                                  of her... she is very much a mother, and
                                  Kaehmi was brought up in a mixed-race
                                  household, her father was European, her mother
                                  Asian.  They lived in Scotland or Ireland... 
                                  Can't recall which.

Kaori-Chan 7/2/01   8:56 PM  Hiroshi wasn't a child that thought of the
                                  details of life, he didn't systemize all of
                                  it... his entire childhood was surprisingly
                                  simplistic.
                                  
                                  Daisuke's, however, was not.

AV         7/2/01   9:03 PM  have you ever heard of gestalt theory? 
                                  
                                  I never said that little girls are
                                  analytically aware of these things, they are
                                  intuitively, wholistically conscious of social
                                  and cultural complexities... an analytical
                                  mind picks out all the individual details and
                                  then struggles to form a complete picture. but
                                  the gestalt mind takes in the whole picture
                                  and distills the patterns and dynamics within
                                  it... Hiroshi and Daisuke are equally
                                  intelligent, but their intelligence is applied
                                  to very different ways of processing
                                  information... Hiroshi understands people, and
                                  what makes them tick, while Daisuke can't seem
                                  to understand people at all... and, certainly,
                                  Daisuke can crunch numbers and theories, and
                                  grasp technology on a level that makes
                                  Hiroshi's head spin...

                                  breath:: 
                                  I am not making it complex... I AM complex...
                                  this is how I think... I grasp an idea and
                                  trace it to the tiniest branches and deepest
                                  roots... once I understand the whole picture,
                                  I focus in on what I want to emphasize... 
                                  
                                  if I tell you a story about an ant pushing a
                                  pebble across the sands of a desert, I already
                                  know what's going on in the rest of the world,
                                  where the wind that blows the pebble away for
                                  a moment, came from... and thus, about the
                                  storms in Africa and the drought in
                                  Nebraska... I obviously ignore all of that and
                                  focus on the ant and the pebble... I really
                                  can't help thinking about the bigger picture

AV         7/2/01   9:10 PM  I see the world in a grain of sand

Kaori-Chan 7/2/01   9:11 PM  but lets not.
                                  
                                  Look, I think about the bigger picture all the
                                  time with fragile clay, but Kaehmi, she isn't
                                  concerned with it, she doesn't think about it.
                                   If someone's feelings are hurt, she might be
                                  aware of it, but she is just a child.
                                  
                                  Something important to a child is a gift from
                                  a loved one, or something that was troublesome
                                  to get...  and both are emotional attachments.
                                   Children are very emotional.

Kaori-Chan 7/2/01   9:12 PM  If Memeko tried explaining to Kaehmi why
                                  Hiroshi left, she likely wouldn't understand,
                                  because she cannot grasp the complexities in
                                  adult relationships.
                                  
                                  

AV         7/2/01   9:16 PM  then, perhaps, I am not the person you want to
                                  write this chapter... not saying I won't...
                                  but, you need to consider who you are talking
                                  to... ::shakes her head:: 
                                  
                                  it's up to you... I'll be back in a... in and
                                  out for the next few hours...

Kaori-Chan 7/2/01   9:19 PM  I think you can write it, Alex, but you need
                                  to take a step back, and not make everything
                                  as complex as all your other stories.
                                  
                                  She's a six year old girl... if she was ten,
                                  maybe the details you think are relevant might
                                  matter, but... they don't, not to a six year
                                  old.
                                  
                                  I've got two nephews, one seven, and one
                                  five... and neither of them act on the things
                                  you are talking about, and they're boys! 
                                  Girls generally are more concerned with being
                                  pretty or things that aesthetically are
                                  appealing to them, they like making others
                                  feel good when they can (Unless they come from
                                  a broken household, or some other influencing
                                  factors).
                                  
                                  I could see Kaehmi being needlessly selfish,
                                  since her Father was rich and her Grandparents
                                  not even close to poverty (As their house
                                  would show).

AV         7/2/01   9:27 PM  all stories, even the simplest, fit into a
                                  greater context... the story may focus on a
                                  six year old girl, but she's a member of a
                                  40,000 year old family, the human race... the
                                  questions I asked, and the thoughts I
                                  expressed have to do with figuring out shere
                                  this girl is in the context of the human
                                  race... once I can see that, I can focus on
                                  the details which the little girl is concerned
                                  with... if you want to offer some guidelines,
                                  great... 

Kaori-Chan 7/2/01   9:28 PM  *Sighs*
                                  
                                  Maybe you are exactly the wrong person for
                                  this story.
                                  

Kaori-Chan 7/2/01   9:29 PM  I can't conceive of you thinking like a seven
                                  your old girl, if you have always thought like
                                  this.

Kaori-Chan 7/2/01   9:39 PM  I'm sorry... *Sighs*

AV         7/2/01   9:39 PM  ::laughs:: thinking like a seven year old girl
                                  is a product of something that often happens
                                  to me, which is *feeling* like a seven year
                                  old girl... my thought patterns are profoundly
                                  effected

Kaori-Chan 7/2/01   9:41 PM  I don't ask a lot of people to write
                                  stories.... and I feel that I can trust you
                                  with such things.
                                  
                                  Perhaps instead of talking about it I should
                                  let you think about it and then show me what
                                  you think up....  instead of just debating it.
                                  
                                  If it's too complex then, I'll say so... okay?

AV         7/2/01   9:43 PM  really, what you've stumbled on is one of the
                                  weaknesses of collaboration... which is, we
                                  don't think alike... we operate from different
                                  assumptions and have different perspectives...
                                  you've had a glimpse of me going into writing
                                  assessment and proposal mode... it's not
                                  indicative of the way the finished story comes
                                  out... it's a way for me to gather information
                                  to consider as I ponder the story idea... 
                                  
                                  that's fine... I'll keep thinking about it,
                                  and see if I can come up with an outline

Kaori-Chan 7/2/01   9:44 PM  you can ask me some stuff... I'll try and be
                                  better about it.  Nick Leifker worked almost
                                  entirely on his own idea when I asked him to
                                  write a Daisuke fic.

AV         7/2/01   9:52 PM  that's fine... all I was really trying to do
                                  was tap into whatever family history, culture
                                  or traditions might apply to Hiroshi, Memeko
                                  and Kaehmi... or even your version of
                                  Nerima... I need your input to make this
                                  really a part of your universe... beyond that,
                                  I can take my inspiration from the characters
                                  themselves...

Kaori-Chan 7/2/01   9:53 PM  well, ask your questions, try and make them
                                  linear.  ^>^ Might help.

AV         7/2/01   9:53 PM  for Kaehmi, the red ribbon might be nothing
                                  more than a pretty bauble... but for the
                                  people around her it might have incredible
                                  significance

AV         7/2/01   9:54 PM  as it was a title element, I focused on the
                                  possability that it does hold a deeper meaning

Kaori-Chan 7/2/01   9:54 PM  would rather not... the significance should
                                  only be by association with it's importance to
                                  Kaehmi.

AV         7/2/01   9:54 PM  fine

Kaori-Chan 7/2/01   9:55 PM  that's what I meant, that the ribbon by itself
                                  is insignificant, but it's significance is
                                  important to kaehmi alone and anyone who know
                                  it's importance to her...
                                  
                                  it's kind of like a child having a favorite
                                  toy and giving it away.

AV         7/2/01   9:55 PM  let me think it over for a night or two... or,
                                  is this something you wanted put together in
                                  the immediate future?

Kaori-Chan 7/2/01   9:56 PM  I'm not sure about the title at all, a
                                  different idea is perfectly acceptable and it
                                  could have nothing to do with red ribbons.

AV         7/2/01   10:06 PM that's fine...

Kaori-Chan 7/2/01   10:07 PM I hope I am not hurting you or upsetting you,
                                  Alex...

AV         7/2/01   10:08 PM not at all... I am just a bit distracted...
                                  have a lot of things on my mind and I'm not
                                  glued to the computer... sorry this slows
                                  things down so much, but I can't sit still

Kaori-Chan 7/2/01   10:09 PM aaah, the fidgetiness.

AV         7/2/01   10:27 PM oh yes... and, of course there's a TV in four
                                  different rooms in the house, and usually at
                                  least two are on, and I walk by and get sucked
                                  in for a bit before I have to jump up and
                                  wander somewhere else! ::giggle::

Kaori-Chan 7/2/01   10:27 PM I hardly watch TV, and there's one right above
                                  this computer.

AV         7/2/01   10:28 PM I got that impression when I was talking about
                                  the show on Atlantis, and you were channel
                                  surfing to see if you could find it! ::smile::

Kaori-Chan 7/2/01   10:28 PM yeah, even then I watch hardly any television.

AV         7/2/01   10:31 PM usually, TV is not a big interest... I like to
                                  watch movies and the Discovery type channels
                                  are very intriguinging at times... but network
                                  television usually makes me ill... if I am
                                  bored, or if there's something on my mind I
                                  can't do anything about at the moment, I'll
                                  watch TV... and occasionally a particular show
                                  will catch my interest, like Farscape... and
                                  I'll try to watch it regularily... but, I
                                  prefer to read... I'd much more prefer to have
                                  the body to go out and have the kind of fun
                                  I've only dreamed of! ::distant starry look in

Kaori-Chan 7/2/01   10:35 PM *laughs* Okay.  =)

                                  I'm starting to get tired.. wish I could just
                                  crawl into your lap and take a little nap

Kaori-Chan 7/2/01   10:45 PM *Smiles* I'm talking to that girl I was
                                  telling you about the other day....  *Strokes
                                  your back gently*

                                  going?

Kaori-Chan 7/2/01   11:00 PM talking to her about what I was thinking. 
                                  *hugs*

AV         7/2/01   11:01 PM I'm putting a movie on that has to be returned
                                  tomorrow... I'll be gone for about two
                                  hours... I'll check in when it's done and talk
                                  to you more about it then, if you're still
                                  awake, alright?

Kaori-Chan 7/2/01   11:01 PM alrighty.  =)

AV         7/2/01   11:02 PM m'kay ::kisses you gently:: enjoy your
                                  conversation with her, and good luck!

Kaori-Chan 7/2/01   11:02 PM *Nods* I doubt it'll result in anything, but I
                                  am going to talk about it.

AV         7/3/01   1:30 AM  I'm back for a bit...

Kaori-Chan 7/3/01   1:31 AM  hey hon.  =)  What movie and how was it?

AV         7/3/01   1:37 AM  um... Proof of Life with Meg Ryan and Russel
                                  Crowe... it was pretty good

Kaori-Chan 7/3/01   1:37 AM  huh, I remember that being in theaters but I
                                  didn't see it because it sounded odd and other
                                  stuff was in the theater.  ^>^

AV         7/3/01   1:38 AM  not surprised... a lot of good movies don't
                                  sound good at the theatres... then you end up
                                  renting them, wondering what the hell it is,
                                  and it turns out to be pretty decent

Kaori-Chan 7/3/01   1:39 AM  aaah.  Doesn't happen much to me. ^^;
                                  

AV         7/3/01   1:40 AM  ::smiles:: well, the truth is, I don't tend to
                                  catch a lot of shows in the theatres, so it
                                  happens more often for me...
                                  
                                  so, how did you little talk go?

Kaori-Chan 7/3/01   1:41 AM  still talking with her, she's got a lot of
                                  concerns, that she might not come back to UAF
                                  this next semester and such.
                                  

AV         7/3/01   1:42 AM  really? have you just been talking about
                                  stuff, or has the possability of getting
                                  together for some quality time come up?

Kaori-Chan 7/3/01   1:43 AM  well, we talked about our mutual attraction
                                  and such, but can't do anything about that
                                  since we're a few hundred miles apart.
                                  
                                  We're very good friends, and I'm sure we'll be
                                  able to talk about it later as well.

AV         7/3/01   1:43 AM  okay... so, care to tell me a bit about her...
                                  and, does she know about me? 

AV         7/3/01   1:44 AM  or, about Rose, I should say...

Kaori-Chan 7/3/01   1:45 AM  She knows about you.  ^>^
                                  
                                  She's happy that I found someone very
                                  compatible with me.  She's known me since high
                                  school, we went to the same HS together since
                                  about sophomore year.

AV         7/3/01   1:45 AM  I don't imagine you told her about my... um...
                                  problem, have you?

Kaori-Chan 7/3/01   1:45 AM  yes, I did.  She actually said Shape Shifting
                                  has happened before.

AV         7/3/01   1:46 AM  ::raises her eyebrow:: wow, that's very cool
                                  of her... did she give you any examples?

Kaori-Chan 7/3/01   1:46 AM  no, but I asked.  She says she wasn't sure,
                                  she just knows it's happened before.

AV         7/3/01   1:48 AM  ::nods:: I'm not surprised... these things
                                  don't seem to get much media attention, but
                                  there are people, at certain times and places,
                                  who have demonstrated such abilities... a lot
                                  of it gets written off as myth or
                                  superstition... like with native americans...
                                  but, there are stories... and there are people
                                  who have witnessed such things

AV         7/3/01   1:49 AM  if you find the book I talked to you about,
                                  the Holographic Universe, the phenomenon is
                                  covered

Kaori-Chan 7/3/01   1:49 AM  truly?

Kaori-Chan 7/3/01   1:50 AM  do you want to talk to Danita?

AV         7/3/01   1:51 AM  well, for the skeptic, it is true that many
                                  questionable things get published... but the
                                  book I'm talking about tends to quote official
                                  records and documentation, as well as books
                                  and papers published by scientists
                                  
                                  um... sure, that might be interesting
                                  ::smile::

AV         7/3/01   1:54 AM  she is on right now, right?

Kaori-Chan 7/3/01   1:54 AM  yeah she is.  ^>^

AV         7/3/01   1:57 AM  okay... I've got her on now...

Kaori-Chan 7/3/01   2:00 AM  Danita's a very nice girl.  ^>^

AV         7/3/01   2:02 AM  hmmm... she calls you Marcus... 

AV         7/3/01   2:02 AM  I didn't have the nerve to try it... except in
                                  my mind

Kaori-Chan 7/3/01   2:03 AM  to try what?

AV         7/3/01   2:03 AM  call you Marcus, my Love

Kaori-Chan 7/3/01   2:05 AM  oh, don't worry about it.  I prefer Mark but
                                  some call me Marcus.

AV         7/3/01   2:07 AM  ::giggles:: well, the thing is, I once thought
                                  to myself that Marcus was a good name for a
                                  lover... ::grin::

Kaori-Chan 7/3/01   2:07 AM  I used to hate my name, I don't much mind it
                                  anymore... particularly because it's Roman.

AV         7/3/01   2:09 AM  ::nods:: yes, a nice romantic name... one that
                                  conveys strength, responsability,
                                  intelligence, and of course masculinity
                                  ::licks her lips::

Kaori-Chan 7/3/01   2:10 AM  oy, I wish I was responsible.

AV         7/3/01   2:12 AM  hard to be responsible in a world where no one
                                  takes responsability, isn't it? a world where
                                  no one knows the value of anything... I don't
                                  think you lack it, you have just been too
                                  repulsed to want to make that kind of
                                  commitment, knowing that if you did commit
                                  you'd be stuck with an anchor around your neck

Kaori-Chan 7/3/01   2:13 AM  *Sighs* Yeah, something like that... =(  A
                                  job, a family, things like that... I want
                                  them, but... I seem so lazy.  =(

AV         7/3/01   2:16 AM  it's called disaffection... a soul to strong
                                  to give in to apathy, and too sensitive to
                                  give in to rage... you stop and look around
                                  you and... take several steps back

Kaori-Chan 7/3/01   2:18 AM  Really? Is that a clinical dysfunction?

AV         7/3/01   2:21 AM  yes... and no... I suppose it's like
                                  dysphoria... disaffection is a descriptive
                                  term that can show up in a diagnosis... it's
                                  not quite depression, but it does lead in that
                                  direction... 

Kaori-Chan 7/3/01   2:22 AM  aaah.  *Sighs*

AV         7/3/01   2:24 AM  ::slips into your lap and cuddles up:: you are
                                  not lazy... you are understandable put off...
                                  why build bridges in a world where everyone is
                                  focused on tearing them down... it's not
                                  laziness but prudence... don't build your
                                  house on the sandy ground... conserve your
                                  energy for a better day

AV         7/3/01   2:25 AM  when you find the land of your dreams, this
                                  lethargy will slip away and you will be hard
                                  pressed to drag yourself away from your work,
                                  because true work is a thing of passion

Kaori-Chan 7/3/01   2:25 AM  yeah, something like that I guess.  *Smiles*

Kaori-Chan 7/3/01   2:25 AM  hai.... I wish I had that.  ^>^

AV         7/3/01   2:26 AM  don't worry, it will come... right now, the
                                  world is dragging you down... and, no doubt
                                  your friends and family have not understood
                                  your potential, and instead of encouraing and
                                  nurturing you, they tried to provoke you,
                                  harass you, push you, and so you became what
                                  they accused you of, just to shut them up

Kaori-Chan 7/3/01   2:27 AM  huh??? No, my parents have never really pushed
                                  me or anything.

AV         7/3/01   2:29 AM  hmmm... ::looks at you seriously:: there are
                                  many ways of being pushed... you call yourself
                                  lazy, but, where did you first hear that from?
                                  truly lazy people tend to think of themselves
                                  as "efficient" rather than lazy

Kaori-Chan 7/3/01   2:30 AM  Hon, I haven't showered for a couple weeks
                                  now, I don't think I haven't had the TIME,
                                  I've done nothing but hang around the house.

AV         7/3/01   2:32 AM  it sounds like depression to me

Kaori-Chan 7/3/01   2:32 AM  no, because I'm not depressed, I am happy and
                                  content since meeting you, I just have no
                                  motivation at all.. none.  ^^;

AV         7/3/01   2:34 AM  I was thinking more along the lines of
                                  clinical depression... and I said it sounds
                                  like... not that I think it is... maybe you're
                                  just a skanky old bastard! 

Kaori-Chan 7/3/01   2:35 AM  I'm just lazy. I need someone to push me, and
                                  help me out, and ride my ass until I do
                                  something.

AV         7/3/01   2:37 AM  lack of motivation... resulting in laziness...
                                  cosmic indifference ^_^
                                  
                                  the hazards of being a dragon... these little
                                  day to day things are so utterly insignificant
                                  as to be almost irritating

Kaori-Chan 7/3/01   2:41 AM  something like that.  ^>^ I am more concerned
                                  with other worlds, thoughts of fantasy and
                                  other places....

AV         7/3/01   2:42 AM  ::nods:: that's my dragon, dreaming dreams of
                                  other realities... 
                                  still, I imagine there must be something that
                                  will wake you up... 

Kaori-Chan 7/3/01   2:43 AM  Success, perhaps....
                                  
                                  full blown success.  Either that or I shall be
                                  beaten down by life, into the dust of the
                                  dreary.

AV         7/3/01   2:46 AM  ah, you con't care for this work before reward
                                  system the world operates on? not surprised,
                                  I've slaved my way through life, and received
                                  no rewards until you

Kaori-Chan 7/3/01   2:47 AM  that's my point, see.... I need to make
                                  something that others want, and the world in
                                  my mind is all I have to offer.  It's why I
                                  have to write this campaign setting.

AV         7/3/01   2:50 AM  ::nods:: that's a common problem... its about
                                  having a place in the world... all I have to

                                  so in a sense I have that to offer too... but,
                                  I've found the world demanding little
                                  worthless things from me, which have often
                                  forced me to pawn a part of my soul to come up
                                  with the means of getting them and handing
                                  them over to the world... slave labor
                                  
                                  I have so much more to offer, but... the world
                                  will happily slit your throat and bleed you to
                                  death for a bit of money ::shudders in
                                  horror::

Kaori-Chan 7/3/01   2:51 AM  *nods, sighing*

AV         7/3/01   2:52 AM  you know, I think there is some way we can all
                                  join a chat together... care to give it a try?

Kaori-Chan 7/3/01   2:52 AM  uhm, who?

AV         7/3/01   2:53 AM  you, me and Dani

Kaori-Chan 7/3/01   2:53 AM  uhm, okay, you been talking to her I guess?

AV         7/3/01   2:54 AM  yup!

Kaori-Chan 7/3/01   2:55 AM  well, you start the chat then.

AV         7/3/01   2:57 AM  actually she just announced that she needs to
                                  go to bed ::cute pout::

Kaori-Chan 7/3/01   2:57 AM  what did you two talk about?

AV         7/3/01   2:59 AM  not much... she told me she was happy that you
                                  and I had found each other, I told her how we
                                  seemed to have known each other before we ever
                                  met... each having a bit of the other within
                                  us... and a bit of getting acquainted, what we
                                  majored in, what our interests were, how we
                                  view ourselves and the world

Kaori-Chan 7/3/01   3:01 AM  *listens*

AV         7/3/01   3:01 AM  that's pretty much it... 

AV         7/3/01   3:01 AM  we were just warming up when she had to go

Kaori-Chan 7/3/01   3:07 AM  oh.
                                  
                                  What was her response to what you said? ^>^

AV         7/3/01   3:07 AM  she told me you find her very open minded,
                                  (and I do too) and she said you think very
                                  highly of me, and after talking to me a bit,
                                  she said she could see why you like me so
                                  much... she wishes she could find her soul
                                  mate, I think there is somebody she would love
                                  to know better in person, and I think... well,
                                  she actually said, she would be just as happy
                                  if her soul mate turned out to be female...
                                  she does sound open to experimenting in that
                                  direction (and she said I could tell you
                                  that)... she thinks you are a really great guy
                                  ::smiles and takes your arm, slipping her
                                  fingers through yours::

AV         7/3/01   3:08 AM  AV: sounds interesting... well, tit for tat...
                                  I majored in art in college, so I could devote
                                  most of my attention to my real interest,
                                  unscrewing the unscrutible... my interest is
                                  in the Truth... who and what we are, why we
                                  exist, how things really work... because my
                                  survival depends on performing a miracle
                                  
                                  I love life, I have  a passion for art and
                                  nature, and look at reality as a dream given
                                  substance and solidity by the participation of
                                  individual souls.... 
                                  Stormstar: That's really awesome.
                                  AV: alright, that's fair enough... talk to you
                                  again soon, I hope ::smiles and gives you a
                                  quick hug goodnight::
                                  Stormstar: *returns hug and smiles back*
                                  night.
                                  AV: goodnight Dani... it was wonderful meeting
                                  you!
                                  Stormstar: It was wonderful meeting you as
                                  well Alex
                                  AV: ::smiles:: sleep well
                                  

AV         7/3/01   3:08 AM  easier to just quote the end of the
                                  conversation... hope you don't mind ::grin::

Kaori-Chan 7/3/01   3:09 AM  *nods* You call her Dani? She didn't say
                                  anything? ^>^

AV         7/3/01   3:09 AM  I asked if that was okay, and she said I could
                                  call her Dani or Nita, whichever I was more
                                  comfortable with... 

Kaori-Chan 7/3/01   3:10 AM  huh.  I've always called her Danita, or Nita.

AV         7/3/01   3:11 AM  I just happen to have a particular fondness
                                  for Dani... I used Danielle as an alias, with
                                  a character I was playing, and used Dani for
                                  short... it was when I went by Andrea and
                                  shortened it to Andi, so it was an alias using
                                  the same letters

Kaori-Chan 7/3/01   3:11 AM  aaaah.  =)
                                  
                                  

AV         7/3/01   3:12 AM  I knew I wouldn't keep the name, but I did
                                  become fond of it... thought I would like to
                                  have a friend called Dani... it just rolls off
                                  the tongue kinda nice

Kaori-Chan 7/3/01   3:13 AM  *Smiles* okay.  Well, I hope you and she talk
                                  more... ^>^

AV         7/3/01   3:13 AM  I like her... she said she wanted to talk to
                                  me again... if you had her for a lover, I
                                  don't think I'd mind sharing her... she seems
                                  very sweet

Kaori-Chan 7/3/01   3:14 AM  Oh, so you'd like her too, ne? =)

AV         7/3/01   3:15 AM  ::nods:: I do... 

Kaori-Chan 7/3/01   3:16 AM  *Smiles* Well, we'll see how things pan out,
                                  hon.  =)

AV         7/3/01   3:17 AM  ::blink blink:: oh... just looked at the
                                  time... shouldn'oughtohave done that

                                  ::smiles:: sounds good to me...

Kaori-Chan 7/3/01   3:18 AM  are you off to bed, my love?

AV         7/3/01   3:18 AM  just  about... a couple of minutes

Kaori-Chan 7/3/01   3:19 AM  *Kisses you* I do love you, Alexandrea
                                  Virginia Morgan.

AV         7/3/01   3:20 AM  ::happily becomes absorbed in your kiss for a
                                  moment:: 
                                  I wish three simple words could touch you with
                                  the love I feel for you!

Kaori-Chan 7/3/01   3:21 AM  What would those words be? ^>^

AV         7/3/01   3:21 AM  I

AV         7/3/01   3:21 AM  love

AV         7/3/01   3:21 AM  you

Kaori-Chan 7/3/01   3:22 AM  *Smiles*

AV         7/3/01   3:23 AM  ::licks your smile and kisses you with one of
                                  her own::

Kaori-Chan 7/3/01   3:23 AM  *Savors that kiss, enjoying the brief moment
                                  with you*

AV         7/3/01   3:24 AM  I still hold onto the thought of you inside
                                  me, where we left of making love... and though
                                  it was cyber it makes me happy 

AV         7/3/01   3:26 AM  it reminds me of how you filll the emptiness
                                  in my life

Kaori-Chan 7/3/01   3:27 AM  *Smiles gently, holding you close* And some
                                  day, we will have that sensation of oneness.

AV         7/3/01   3:28 AM  ::closes her eyes and slips her arms around
                                  your neck, holding on to you like a promise::

Kaori-Chan 7/3/01   3:29 AM  *Sighs, gently holding you as if you were made
                                  of glass*

Kaori-Chan 7/3/01   3:32 AM  Two as one... *Sighs*

AV         7/3/01   3:33 AM  ::sighs:: And as One we are...

AV         7/3/01   3:33 AM  whole

AV         7/3/01   3:34 AM  ::looks deep into your eyes:: 

Kaori-Chan 7/3/01   3:35 AM  *Sighs* Sleep, my love... and dream of me.

AV         7/3/01   3:35 AM  and in my dreams is where you'll be

AV         7/3/01   3:35 AM  goodnight, love

Kaori-Chan 7/4/01   2:38 AM  I really wanted to talk to you... I guess it
                                  doesn't matter now.  *sighs*

AV         7/5/01   1:46 AM  why not?

Kaori-Chan 7/5/01   1:48 AM  well... it's kinda vague.
                                  
                                  I had a dream you and I were thrust into a
                                  barren, wasteland world... and that we spoke
                                  of the sacred city, the Diamond City and it's
                                  Crystal Palace.
                                  
                                  And we started an adventure, an exodus with
                                  some wandering people, and we found the city
                                  and then everything was bright and colorful,
                                  and there was a lot of children.

AV         7/5/01   1:49 AM  ::sits down across from you and takes your
                                  hand:: go on...

Kaori-Chan 7/5/01   1:49 AM  that's all I remember.

AV         7/5/01   1:50 AM  hmmm... well... last night I had a dream

Kaori-Chan 7/5/01   1:50 AM  *listens*

AV         7/5/01   1:59 AM  I was laying in my bed, sort of meditating,
                                  and collecting my wits... then I went through
                                  the transformation... just as the
                                  transformation was ending, I suddenly realized
                                  that I was dreaming... that it was not the
                                  real event, even though it had seemed so
                                  realistic... and the realization woke me up...
                                  as I was waking up, I heard a woman's voice
                                  call out "David" which was confusing, because
                                  it seemed so audible, but no one was around...
                                  for a moment I was afraid it was my mother,
                                  who has been struggling with cancer... but on
                                  second thought, that didn't feel right... I
                                  think it was a reminder that there are people
                                  who in their hearts want me to remain as I am,
                                  people who would have a hard letting go of me

Kaori-Chan 7/5/01   2:00 AM  How did you feel about this?

AV         7/5/01   2:03 AM  ::chews her lip thoughtfully:: it makes me a
                                  little sad

Kaori-Chan 7/5/01   2:04 AM  do you want to remain as you are?

AV         7/5/01   2:04 AM  no

Kaori-Chan 7/5/01   2:05 AM  why?

AV         7/5/01   2:12 AM  as I am, I am a ghost to the world... not a
                                  living, breathing, fully participating member
                                  of reality... I am not centered, not firmly
                                  seated in the flesh... I have the capacity to
                                  interface with it, and thus the world
                                  
                                  as real as I am in my own mind, as true as I
                                  am in  my soul... the manner in which I am
                                  embodied obscures my presence in the world
                                  
                                  I am not willing to remain as I am, either...
                                  if I have the option to do anything about
                                  it...

Kaori-Chan 7/5/01   2:13 AM  it makes you sad, but it doesn't change your
                                  mind or your path?

AV         7/5/01   2:13 AM  yes

Kaori-Chan 7/5/01   2:14 AM  I missed you, Alex...

AV         7/5/01   2:18 AM  I know
                                  
                                  I do not withdraw from you to punish you... I
                                  am withdrawn because I devote all that I can
                                  to resolving this situation to the best of my
                                  ability... and often, that does not leave me
                                  with much to spare for those around me... you
                                  want the real me, you want me there in your
                                  arms, so I make it a higher priority to focus
                                  on that than even talking to you
                                  
                                  I put this commitment even higher than love,

                                  myself, and even out of love of life that I do
                                  this

Kaori-Chan 7/5/01   2:19 AM  I feel less depressed when I am with you, in
                                  fact, I hardly feel depressed at all when I
                                  have had just a little while with you.

AV         7/5/01   2:22 AM  me too

                                  you hold me here

Kaori-Chan 7/5/01   2:24 AM  It's nice to say, and I think about you
                                  always, but... sometimes I just need a few
                                  words.

                                  unreasonable request... but, do remember, I am
                                  in an unreasonable situation... the means to
                                  do what I must lie very deep within myself,
                                  and typically I become so submerged in what I
                                  am doing that only a faint spark of myself
                                  remains in touch with the outside world,
                                  operating on autopilot... 

AV         7/5/01   2:33 AM  I am not used to people out there knowing I am
                                  in here

Kaori-Chan 7/5/01   2:34 AM  If you just could be yourself... *sighs*

AV         7/5/01   2:35 AM  I am myself

Kaori-Chan 7/5/01   2:35 AM  I meant... instead of submerging yourself for
                                  others.

                                  frees me to focus my main attention on
                                  cultivating my potential... I am submerged
                                  because I am operating on the level at which
                                  the mind can control space and time, matter
                                  and energy... 

Kaori-Chan 7/5/01   2:40 AM  making any progress?

AV         7/5/01   2:47 AM  ::tilts her head:: I wish I had a definitive
                                  way to measure things on that level... I am

                                  getting impressive, unexpected results...
                                  um... looking for a way to put it... I suppose
                                  it's best to say that things are happening
                                  which... suggest at this point... that success
                                  will come as no surprise
                                  
                                  for a long time, the prospect of manifesting
                                  the kind of power I found latent within myself
                                  made me apprehensive... I worried that I could
                                  not confront that kind of power without
                                  experiencing shock... or that I could not
                                  possibly overcome the apprehension engendered
                                  by that kind of power enough to actually
                                  manifest it... what I am doing seems to be
                                  changing that

Kaori-Chan 7/5/01   2:48 AM  *nods, listening quietly as his love speaks*

AV         7/5/01   2:50 AM  for some people, to attempt what I am, they
                                  would have to overcome their disbelief... I
                                  never had that problem... I believed, and
                                  understood what it was I was messing with...
                                  for me, it was the keen awareness of the
                                  consequences of such power, such potential,
                                  that disturbed me... I have spent my life
                                  trying to develop into someone who can cope
                                  with the consequences of actions performed at
                                  such a level

Kaori-Chan 7/5/01   2:54 AM  you said some things have encouraged you???

AV         7/5/01   2:56 AM  I've known a lot of people intelligent enough,
                                  or intuitive enough, to conceive of the
                                  possabilities of existence... more often,
                                  people don't want to think of the
                                  possabilities, and even people who do, don't
                                  want to think about the full ramifications of
                                  such possabilities... don't want to think
                                  about the consequences
                                  
                                  um... encouragement can come in very subtle
                                  forms... I've found encouragement every step
                                  of the way... particularly in the fact that
                                  I've been allowed to make mistakes and learn
                                  from them without compromising my goals or my
                                  integrity

Kaori-Chan 7/5/01   2:57 AM  true, but.. what sort of things have you been
                                  doing in your subconcious??? I'm a bit
                                  confused.

AV         7/5/01   3:00 AM  you should be... what happens at the
                                  subconscious and unconscious levels are truly
                                  occult... in the sense that they reveal very
                                  little, but like all great secrets, they are
                                  hidden in plain sight... there is no forbidden
                                  knowledge... people deliberately ignore most
                                  of it, and when they find it impossible to
                                  ignore, they begin to deny it and avoid it...
                                  the surest sign that they are not ready for it

AV         7/5/01   3:03 AM  what have I been doing in my subconscious and
                                  unconscious? I've been nurturing the
                                  integration of my entire consciousness

Kaori-Chan 7/5/01   3:05 AM  I guess it is for you to understand and me to
                                  just support.....

AV         7/5/01   3:09 AM  the conscious mind functions as the pilot or
                                  captain of a ship... the subconscious mind is
                                  a complex heirarchy that functions as the
                                  crew... starting from executive officer, staff
                                  officers, officers, specialists, general crew,
                                  on down the line... the unconscious mind is...
                                  in a way, the ship itself... the world matrix,
                                  or world interface... so, in that sense, I've
                                  been familiarizing myself with the crew and
                                  the ship, and trying to turn the whole complex
                                  into an efficient and effective corporate
                                  organism

Kaori-Chan 7/5/01   4:19 AM  I do not frighten you? Then why avoid me?

AV         7/5/01   4:21 AM  ::hangs her head:: because... several times
                                  now, you've pushed me away...

Kaori-Chan 7/5/01   4:23 AM  it will happen again I am sure... but that you
                                  do not let me go, it means a great deal to
                                  me.... that you would put up with my crap.

AV         7/5/01   4:28 AM  I try to understand what's going through your
                                  mind... and, I don't know if you're just
                                  testing me, or if I truely make you feel
                                  insecure... I won't always put up with your
                                  crap... I can't... it would be bad for both of
                                  us... but... that's not what would make me
                                  leave... it's the thought that you don't trust
                                  me... ::shakes her head::

Kaori-Chan 7/5/01   4:30 AM  this is how I've always been.  Many dump me
                                  because they are incapable of taking my repeat
                                  offenses.

AV         7/5/01   4:31 AM  ::sighs::

Kaori-Chan 7/5/01   4:32 AM  like I said... I am a disappointment.  This is
                                  what you get, loud mouth, arrogant,
                                  troublesome me.

AV         7/5/01   4:33 AM  if I trust you, and you don't trust me... you
                                  will hurt me, and that part of me is right to
                                  be alarmed
                                  I can't let you hurt me like that, Mark... I
                                  have too much respect for myself

Kaori-Chan 7/5/01   4:36 AM  I am your choice, or I'm not.

Kaori-Chan 7/5/01   4:44 AM  Alex?

AV         7/5/01   4:44 AM  I love you, Mark... that cannot be undone...
                                  you keep trying to hold up this shitty self
                                  image and drive me away, and it hurts... it
                                  really hurts... you have no idea how much it
                                  hurts... not just because it's ugly on the
                                  surface, not just because it screams that you
                                  don't trust me, but because I am afraid you
                                  really believe it... what could possible have
                                  convinced you you're such a monster? 
                                  
                                  

Kaori-Chan 7/5/01   4:45 AM  the fact that I don't try to be more...

AV         7/5/01   4:49 AM  ::frowns:: that's up to you... the question
                                  is, are you going to spend the rest of your
                                  life throwing that in my face, trying to drive
                                  me away? 

Kaori-Chan 7/5/01   4:50 AM  depends on if you want to believe it.

Kaori-Chan 7/5/01   4:57 AM  It is rather out of hand... but it does not
                                  happen all the time.  I am either one extreme
                                  or another, it seems....
                                  
                                  sometimes I just talk.

AV         7/5/01   5:00 AM  I don't know what it is about provoking me
                                  that turns you on so much

Kaori-Chan 7/5/01   5:01 AM  you misunderstand, I would much rather not be
                                  such a problem.
                                  
                                  when I feel sorry for myself, I feel sorry for
                                  myself... when I don't, I don't.  

AV         7/5/01   5:03 AM  ::tosses her hair and looks away::

Kaori-Chan 7/5/01   5:03 AM  *Looks hurt* Alex.. please.

AV         7/5/01   5:04 AM  you're asking for a punch in the chops, mister

Kaori-Chan 7/5/01   5:05 AM  why?

AV         7/5/01   5:06 AM  ::looks back at you with a tear stained face::

AV         7/5/01   5:09 AM  you give me every reason to walk away from
                                  you...
                                  ...but the heart is not governed by reason

Kaori-Chan 7/5/01   5:12 AM  *Sighs deeply...* All my life I've wanted
                                  someone to love, someone to love me and
                                  someone who would understand me and why I am
                                  just so messed up, comparitive to most
                                  people...
                                  
                                  Someone who can challenge me, but know how to
                                  do it so that I don't... hurt them because of
                                  it... someone who has a gentle touch and a
                                  forgiving heart, who wouldn't give up on this
                                  flawed person I am.
                                  
                                  Someone who would recognize the things which
                                  make me beautiful, despite those flaws... and
                                  would treasure them, even if they may be
                                  rare...

Kaori-Chan 7/5/01   5:16 AM  *Gently lays his head upon your back* Someone
                                  who can deal with my silent torments, my
                                  ritualistic depressions, my almost but not
                                  quite predictable angers...

Kaori-Chan 7/5/01   5:27 AM  not right now...  I hurt because you love me. 
                                  It... is hard to explain without sounding
                                  sorry for myself.
                                  
                                  I want to be better for you, but do not know
                                  how.

AV         7/5/01   5:27 AM  you have to want to be better for you, and
                                  that's the one thing I can't give you

Kaori-Chan 7/5/01   5:28 AM  maybe I just don't understand.

AV         7/5/01   5:29 AM  I'd expect that from a dragon

Kaori-Chan 7/5/01   5:31 AM  is that what makes up most of your time with
                                  me? Me feeling sorry for myself? I never
                                  thought it was so prevalent...

AV         7/5/01   5:37 AM  it's not always this naked... more often than
                                  not, it's an undercurrent, a subtext that...
                                  certain people can pick up quickly, even if
                                  they can't isolate it or identify it... it's
                                  what set Launce off... I tend to look past it,
                                  but most people are conditioned not to look
                                  beneath the surface of things... 
                                  
                                  now that you've found what you were looking
                                  for, you don't need to keep driving the world
                                  away looking for the one who won't freak... it
                                  might just make your life a little less bleak

Kaori-Chan 7/5/01   5:38 AM  it isn't just finding you, my place here in
                                  this world is also bleakly depressing for me.

AV         7/5/01   5:45 AM  you get what you put into it

Kaori-Chan 7/5/01   5:46 AM  that's what I'm afraid of...
                                  
                                  I guess I am scared.  I've never dealt with

                                  have the tools and skills required to cope.

                                  I can't spend all my nights staying up and
                                  talking, hon.

                                  too often

Kaori-Chan 7/5/01   11:51 PM sorry if I sounded upset, but it is a
                                  frustration.

AV         7/6/01   12:19 AM ::looks at you::

AV         7/6/01   12:19 AM I will admit, it does appear that I am taking
                                  you for granted...

AV         7/6/01   12:20 AM if appearances are all that matter here, than,
                                  by appearances it's clear that this would
                                  never have worked out

AV         7/6/01   12:21 AM I thought there was something deeper than
                                  that, however... I thought you truly
                                  appreciated the situation I am in

AV         7/6/01   12:21 AM I thought you understood me, at least a little

Kaori-Chan 7/6/01   12:21 AM if you care about me at all, you NEVER treat
                                  me like that.
                                  
                                  You don't know the kind of women I've had to
                                  deal with growing up, and frankly I am getting
                                  sick of being used as a doormat.
                                  
                                  

Kaori-Chan 7/6/01   12:22 AM I don't know who you are anymore.

AV         7/6/01   12:23 AM how about the way you treated me? care to
                                  comment on that?

Kaori-Chan 7/6/01   12:23 AM what's to treat? YOU HAVEN'T EVEN BEEN ONLINE.

AV         7/6/01   12:25 AM there is nothing ONLINE that is going to help
                                  me manifest my true self... there is quite a
                                  lot right here around me that I have to deal
                                  with that only makes it harder to accomplish
                                  what I need to do

Kaori-Chan 7/6/01   12:26 AM okay, so manifesting yourself takes precedence
                                  over actually commiting some emotional time to
                                  a relationship.
                                  
                                  I got it.  *Thumbs up*

AV         7/6/01   12:27 AM to thine own self be true... and it follows,
                                  as night follows day, you can not then be
                                  false to any man

AV         7/6/01   12:27 AM no one is helping me, Mark... no one is going
                                  to give this to me... 

AV         7/6/01   12:28 AM I have to earn it from a part of myself that
                                  is far more critical and demanding than even
                                  you are

Kaori-Chan 7/6/01   12:28 AM yeah, that's right, so why alienate the person
                                  who actually gives a damn? You've been
                                  treating me like shit this past week.

Kaori-Chan 7/6/01   12:28 AM did it ever occur to you that I just may want
                                  to spend time with you, regardless of your
                                  body?

AV         7/6/01   12:31 AM who's been alienating who, Mark? I have been
                                  taking the time I need to hold on to my sanity
                                  and pursue a miracle...  that is all... you've
                                  been selfish and impatient and distrustful of
                                  me... you are taking this way to personally

Kaori-Chan 7/6/01   12:33 AM Look...
                                  
                                  I spent three years of my life online.
                                  
                                  I would rather not repeat that three years
                                  with another three years.
                                  
                                  Maybe I should just start doing things, and
                                  completely forget you are even here, would
                                  that make you happy? It's what I used to do to
                                  my last boyfriend.

AV         7/6/01   12:41 AM I spent thirty years of my life fighting for
                                  my soul
                                  
                                  I would rather not spend another thirty years
                                  trying to cling to hope while all I have
                                  worked for is unraveled by distractions
                                  
                                  I am not the solution to the problems in your
                                  life... I am only the woman who loves you
                                  enough to accept you for who and what you
                                  are... if you are too afraid of getting hurt,
                                  and you want to retreat, I can accept that...
                                  because I have had to swallow a tremendous
                                  amount of pain and bitterness, and even your
                                  hatred is not enough to destroy me... I will
                                  still love you, and I will still think of you,
                                  and still want to seek you out in person as
                                  soon as I am able... 
                                  
                                  I found myself by trusting my instincts and
                                  intuition... I found you by trusting my
                                  instincts and intuition... I have continued to
                                  listen to my instincts and intuition, and yes,
                                  I know this is bothering you, but again and
                                  again, I am being slapped in the head and told
                                  to stay focused on what I am doing... to do
                                  what I need to do, not what I want to do...
                                  which is to make you happy...

Kaori-Chan 7/6/01   12:43 AM this isn't about me, you think I think only of
                                  myself when i want to see you?
                                  
                                  What if I was gone for a week, no explanation,
                                  and you were waiting for me online every day?

AV         7/6/01   12:53 AM from what I have to go on, it is a fair
                                  interpretation of what's going on in your
                                  mind... I like to think that you're true
                                  feelings and thoughts are not being clearly
                                  represented, and I always give you the benefit
                                  of the doubt
                                  
                                  if our roles were reversed, I can tell you
                                  that, for the most part, I have enough faith
                                  in you to believe that if you are not
                                  available, then there is a good reason, and
                                  that you can take care of yourself in any
                                  reasonable situation... and since there is
                                  nothing I can do in the event of some disaster
                                  or tragedy, all I can do is be patient and
                                  believe in you
                                  
                                  and, for the record, I've already been through
                                  that... when you asked me to get on irc and it
                                  took me almost a month to begin regular
                                  communication with you... you were gone for a
                                  couple of weeks on a trip to Washington, and I
                                  had no clue... no explanation... and I had
                                  already told you that I loved you... I didn't
                                  know why, but I knew there was something very
                                  important between us
                                  
                                  I could do nothing, but instead of getting up
                                  set, I did what I always do... I focused on
                                  improving my own situation... against all
                                  odds, all adversity... eventually I realized
                                  that looking for you online everynight was not
                                  getting me anywhere, and I began to relax my
                                  vigil... when the time was right, we would be
                                  able to talk again... I accepted it

Kaori-Chan 7/6/01   12:55 AM "I would think you decided when you got
                                  online."
                                  
                                  "Get over it."

AV         7/6/01   12:57 AM you had just apologised for getting bitchy,
                                  and I forgave you... and the very next thing
                                  you did was imply that I was taking you for
                                  granted... I tried to find a way to respond to
                                  that, but everything I tried sounded like
                                  making excuses or lecturing you... I did not
                                  want to waste our time on accusations and
                                  recriminations... what happened happened... I
                                  accepted your apology... maybe I was thinking.
                                  "look, just drop it" and it did come out as
                                  "get over it"... it was that or kick you in
                                  the shins

AV         7/6/01   12:58 AM you know you are an exapserating man, and the
                                  fact that I did get on so late might have
                                  sugested that today was not a good day for me 

AV         7/6/01   12:59 AM and you know damn well what a temper I have

Kaori-Chan 7/6/01   1:00 AM  Yes, maybe you had a bad day, that was
                                  inconsiderate of me.
                                  
                                  However, do you ever think of my own feelings,
                                  or are you too concerned with making your wish
                                  come true?

AV         7/6/01   1:07 AM  I think of your feelings all the time... and
                                  it is not at all easy to keep from being
                                  distracted by that awareness... I have to keep
                                  stopping and reassessing everything, weighing
                                  what is most important... and I will tell you
                                  this... before you, the thought of spending
                                  another moment as I am is a knife in the gut,
                                  thrust by every breath, every heartbeat... add
                                  to that that... I want to be with you... I
                                  don't want to just talk to you, I want to be
                                  WITH you... as much as I love the written
                                  word, I am geared to FULL communication,
                                  facial expression, body language, all of
                                  that... I am more than willing to be miserable
                                  now to acheive the thing I really want... 

Kaori-Chan 7/6/01   1:08 AM  I am sorry...
                                  
                                  this is too much for me, too often.
                                  
                                  I apologize for my behavior.  I have to sleep
                                  now.

AV         7/6/01   1:11 AM  it's okay... I understand... I wish it was
                                  possible to share what I understand with
                                  you... let you look inside me and know what I
                                  know... I forgive you... 
                                  
                                  go to bed, go to sleep, and when you dream,
                                  dream of me, for in your dreams is where I'll
                                  be... ::she leans forward and kisses you on
                                  your forehead::

                                  Entwined in Rapture, we;
                                  I an dthee, eternally.
                                  Trapped by fate's clasp
                                  Onward, cycling fatally.
                                  
                                  Serpent's spout, Magick flame
                                  Caressing coils wrap your form.
                                  Wings of molten Vitae,
                                  Stroke my gripping coils warm.
                                  
                                  Chained, always struggle
                                  In balance, ever we dance.
                                  One of two, both whole,
                                  Never we, children of chance.

                                  with me, and claimed connections with the

AV         7/6/01   9:10 PM  yes... a little of this, a little of that... 

Kaori-Chan 7/6/01   9:12 PM  Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn?

AV         7/6/01   9:13 PM  I was not able to get through the first book,
                                  but I did make it through the last one... the
                                  one they had to split in two to publish in
                                  paperback

Kaori-Chan 7/6/01   9:15 PM  The first book with Tad is always the hardest,
                                  but also very important since it introduces
                                  all the characters and explains their
                                  personalities.
                                  
                                  Almost always, his first book in a series is
                                  setting the stage.  =)

AV         7/6/01   9:16 PM  I know... I, unfortunately started with the
                                  last book and had to work my way backward,
                                  and... ::chuckle:: by the time I got to the
                                  first book  I was exhausted

Kaori-Chan 7/6/01   9:17 PM  O.o
                                  
                                  Why are you always reading things backwards
                                  like?

AV         7/6/01   9:19 PM  because of book stores, mostely... I'd browse
                                  the shelves, find something interesting and
                                  start reading... I'd get a couple of chapters
                                  in and realize that there was a prequel or
                                  two, and go back to get the first one and they
                                  wouldn't have it... I'd end up finishing the
                                  one I already had before tracking down the one
                                  that came before it

Kaori-Chan 7/6/01   9:20 PM  mm.
                                  
                                  Guess I'm weird, but then, I guess I'm not as
                                  book heavy as some other people...
                                  
                                  

AV         7/6/01   9:21 PM  I go in spurts... especially if I can find a
                                  good used book store... I'll but a whole
                                  series at once and hole up for as long as it
                                  takes to read them all... but, I'll also go
                                  for months without reading anything

Kaori-Chan 7/6/01   9:22 PM  Seems a lot of people read more than me, but
                                  they read shorter books.
                                  
                                  Tad Williams is huge novel length.

AV         7/6/01   9:31 PM  yes, they are... but, I actually like that in
                                  a book... (sorry for the slow response, was
                                  off in another room for a bit)

                                  all the jokes, but I found it hilarious with

Kaori-Chan 7/8/01   12:39 AM hehehe.

AV         7/8/01   12:40 AM ::grins:: and then, we got to talking about
                                  martial arts, and then Launce demonstrated
                                  some moves, and we ended up in an inpromptu
                                  lesson... hence, I get back later than

                                  when he taps you it's like what most people
                                  accomplish when they're seriously trying to
                                  hurt you

                                  other ridiculous problem would crop up and...
                                  net result, I never learned much of anything

                                  that it was not that much different... except
                                  a few people stayed the same, where before I
                                  was the only thing that stayed the same

AV         7/9/01   2:21 AM  a disturbing dream last night, but the details
                                  escape me... a dream in which I had a grip on
                                  reality, and tried to assert myself, only to
                                  face an accusation that I was a lie... but, it
                                  was simply a malicious accusation... what
                                  really disturbed me was that I woke up
                                  struggling to breathe...
                                  
                                  as for details of the day, there was...
                                  nothing outstanding, but I recognized a
                                  trend... people simply don't think the way I
                                  do, they don't see things the way I do, and
                                  thus... all I have done, all that I am, has no
                                  value to such people... I know that there are
                                  people like you who believe in me...  but I
                                  also know that people like us, living in the
                                  world we do, are crippled by the beliefs and
                                  assumptions of people who succeed in a world
                                  like this

AV         7/9/01   2:31 AM  doesn't sound very encouraging, I know... I
                                  just... I look at things and become so
                                  unhappy... I've always had people trying to
                                  get me to accept things the way they are, to
                                  stop trying to change things and simply find
                                  someway to be happy with what I've got...
                                  but... I look at the world and it all seems so
                                  *wrong* 
                                  
                                  I can't live like this... to be so conscious
                                  of things and powerless to act... I can't even
                                  take care of myself! I can *feel* what's
                                  missing! it drives me crazy...

                                  and unnecessary... and, again and again, I
                                  pick up the message that to presume that I
                                  have anything to offer the world is madness or
                                  arrogance... 
                                  
                                  a person can only live by her beliefs, and at
                                  times it becomes necessary to die for those
                                  beliefs... in the world we live in, people
                                  live and die for the belief that no belief is
                                  worth dying for... what happens to a champion
                                  of the human soul in a world that has come to
                                  regard the soul as a meaningless,
                                  inconsequential superstition?

Kaori-Chan 7/9/01   2:40 AM  I do not know.... it is a concern of my own as

                                  such a potent, negative effect... I struggle
                                  and struggle, and it seems as if I remain
                                  paralyzed...

                                  works... I wish I knew when the pointless
                                  struggling will be over... when I'll be

AV         7/9/01   3:00 AM  nope... writing is an early casualty of this

                                  working on it, but the actual writing turns to
                                  crap if I am in such a worn out state... the
                                  fact that I've kept myself from actually

                                  for me it's hard to cry out, because I don't
                                  like to say or do things I do not really
                                  mean... I try to maintain my composure, I try
                                  to cope and coexist with it... I don't even
                                  particularly care if that makes me look like a
                                  better person... I know all too well how much
                                  of human behavior is face... manners and
                                  protocol... a good actor can always portray an
                                  ideal person... but... I suppose being a good
                                  person matters to me because I am actually
                                  sincere in my efforts
                                  
                                  I am very deliberate about being a beautiful
                                  person... I look at myself as... well, all I
                                  really have, so the person I appear to be is
                                  really all I have to offer the world, so of
                                  course I want to give my very best... it makes
                                  me happy as an "artist" and it makes people
                                  around me happy, because it's nice to have a
                                  little beauty in the world... I question my
                                  motives, but that's just good form... I can't
                                  see what could possibly be questionable about
                                  my  motives

AV         7/9/01   3:18 AM  um... you still there?

AV         7/9/01   3:20 AM  ::poke poke::

Kaori-Chan 7/9/01   3:21 AM  yes, was getting some food and then reading
                                  your reply...

AV         7/9/01   3:21 AM  ::nods::

Kaori-Chan 7/9/01   3:22 AM  I feel much the same way, except I feel as if
                                  I've stopped caring what others think of me,
                                  because I was always taken advantage of since
                                  I was a nice guy.

AV         7/9/01   3:30 AM  I faced that crisis... it was part of what
                                  freed me... I realized that I really couldn't
                                  control what people thought of me, and that
                                  there was no point trying to be the person
                                  other people wanted me to be... I guess, I
                                  don't mind people taking advantage of me... I
                                  think that a lot of people can never
                                  appreciate what you can give them, they only
                                  value what they can take from you... and, if
                                  someone wants to take something from you,
                                  there is fuck all you can really do about
                                  it... 
                                  
                                  it taught me a lot about what is really real
                                  and what is not... ultimately, the only thing
                                  you really have is yourself, and no one can
                                  take that away from you... they can hurt you,
                                  and they can kill you, but only you can be
                                  you, y'know... so, they can try to hold on to
                                  you, but the only way they can get anything
                                  out of it is to allow you the freedom to give
                                  of yourself... you will know a true friend by
                                  this... he or she will recognize that there is
                                  no value to anything they can take from you,
                                  and understand that the things you give, the
                                  things you, as a person, have to offer, are
                                  priceless treasures

Kaori-Chan 7/9/01   3:34 AM  not many people value such things.  Frankly, a
                                  great majority of people are raving idiots.

AV         7/9/01   3:35 AM  frankly, the majority of people are unwitting

AV         7/9/01   3:36 AM  our minds are raped as helpless children by

                                  lessons they learned... mother culture has
                                  turned into a devious, soul devouring bitch

Kaori-Chan 7/9/01   3:36 AM  I don't know about that....
                                  
                                  for example, Birgit (The girl prior to you I
                                  had a crush on) did not like my commentary. 
                                  She hated my criticisms, she always took them
                                  seriously evenif they were said in jest, she
                                  elaborated upon some things I said so that
                                  they were perceived in the worst possible
                                  fashion... and all that I wanted, truly, was
                                  to be her friend.

Kaori-Chan 7/9/01   3:37 AM  perhaps I'm a bit too hasty, after all, I have
                                  met some people that genuinely seem to care.
                                  
                                  What do you mean about Mother Culture?

AV         7/9/01   3:38 AM  oh... that's a big topic... 

AV         7/9/01   3:44 AM  hey... one unfortunate side effect of me
                                  having an extra decade on this turf is I've
                                  had the time to pick up on a wide and eclectic
                                  range of references... this one comes from a
                                  variety of sources, including the Boomer
                                  Bible, written by the Punks... and a story
                                  called Ishmael... other sources are a lot
                                  harder to remember, and the real value of them
                                  is the result of hundreds and thousands of
                                  hours of intense discussion and debate with
                                  "friends"

                                  of hours here, a couple of hours there... I
                                  seem to sleep best if I go out on the back

                                  out an announcement that would be on the world
                                  news.

AV         7/11/01  8:20 PM  oh... well, it was the first time I ever paid
                                  any attention to one of those url messages... 

Kaori-Chan 7/11/01  8:22 PM  it's okay, I forgive you... you haven't had
                                  ICQ long.
                                  
                                  Ignore any and all forward messages... such as
                                  messages that say "So and So has a dying
                                  child, forward this and they will pay 5 cents
                                  for each person who forwards"
                                  
                                  there is no way to keep track of forwarded
                                  messages on the ICQ servers.
                                  
                                  so it's pointless to listen to forwards.  Just
                                  forward stuff that you think a person might
                                  like.  Everything else is hogwash.

AV         7/11/01  8:23 PM  no problem... I might have to split for a
                                  little in a few minutes... so if I go
                                  silent... just give me 10 or 15 minutes
                                  
                                  so, guess what?

Kaori-Chan 7/11/01  8:24 PM  what? =)

AV         7/11/01  8:24 PM  I finally got up the nerve to tell my sister
                                  and my mother about you

Kaori-Chan 7/11/01  8:25 PM  Oh???
                                  
                                  Do tell.  *listens*

Kaori-Chan 7/11/01  8:27 PM  oh, mention it and then make me wait, I see.

AV         7/11/01  8:27 PM  sorry... Launce walked in and said, "Okay,

AV         7/11/01  8:54 PM  okay... well, on with the show... I got a
                                  mysterious call from my sister this... er...
                                  afternoon when my valient plan to stay up all
                                  night and day reduced me to a state of near
                                  coma (chuckle) telling me to give her a call
                                  
                                  my mother had brain surgery about 7 years ago
                                  to remove a turmor which turned out to be
                                  melanoma cancer, and this year doctors
                                  discovered a lump in her lung and scheduled a
                                  surgery to remove it... I knew it was supposed
                                  to happen this summer but I didn't know it had
                                  already happened

Kaori-Chan 7/11/01  8:55 PM  *listens*

AV         7/11/01  9:00 PM  I've been a bit out of touch with my family,
                                  in part because for a few weeks I was busy
                                  either working or talking to you into the wee
                                  hours of the morning... and finally my sister
                                  decided to "remind" me that I have a family...
                                  she told me that my mother's surgery went
                                  well, they removed the tumor, which turned out
                                  to be melonoma again (which is very worrisome)
                                  and that she was participating in a new drug
                                  trial for that kind of cancer... she also told
                                  me my brother did get in a motorcycle accident
                                  a couple of weeks ago... but he's only a
                                  little scratched up... he and his wife
                                  announced this last weekend that she's
                                  pregnant (lucky girl!)... I still have to call
                                  them and congratulate them...
                                  
                                  because I had such high hopes of manifesting
                                  on the 21st, I had begun to withdraw from
                                  things a bit, and I've been sort of stuck in
                                  that mode... but the other thing that was
                                  causing me to hesitate to talk to my family
                                  was you

AV         7/11/01  9:06 PM  while I was talking to my sister, I decided to
                                  tell her about meeting you online... finding
                                  my soul mate... falling in love (all over
                                  again!) with you... I told her that you were a
                                  guy, and that you know about me being in a
                                  male body... and that for a while you'd
                                  wondered if you were TS too, before realizing
                                  that the girl who had always haunted you was
                                  the girl of your dreams, and how she turned
                                  out to be me... and how you were the guy I'd
                                  modeled myself as David on... and that we
                                  *knew* each other as if we had known each
                                  other all our lives, that in another life I
                                  was that girl and we were together... and I
                                  also told her that if by *some* miracle I
                                  turned into that girl again (physically) you
                                  wanted me to marry you... 
                                  
                                  when I talked to my mom, I told her the same
                                  thing... about meeting you, about how you knew
                                  the real me better than I could ever explain
                                  myself to someone, and how you had proposed to
                                  me... 

AV         7/11/01  9:07 PM  they were both very happy for me, and they
                                  both said... well, miracles do happen

AV         7/11/01  9:07 PM  ::smiles at you::

Kaori-Chan 7/11/01  9:08 PM  I feel sort of... worried? Depressed? Unsure?
                                  
                                  I am uncertain if I know you quite so well...
                                  I think maybe you give me too much credit.  It
                                  is my nature to question my own feelings, and
                                  examine uncertainty...

AV         7/11/01  9:13 PM  hmmm... all I can do is remember what's
                                  already passed between us... I know that the
                                  person I am now is a bit of an unknown to
                                  you... and I don't expect you to know me in
                                  that sense... I know you love me... 
                                  
                                  You said once that I was the only person you
                                  had ever met who could possible be your
                                  Rose... have I made you doubt that?

Kaori-Chan 7/11/01  9:14 PM  you must remember that I doubt my own sanity
                                  in such matters.

AV         7/11/01  9:14 PM  maybe you question your sanity... but what of
                                  your heart?

Kaori-Chan 7/11/01  9:15 PM  my heart is tired of searching for something
                                  that might not even be real...
                                  
                                  I long for a woman who might not exist, that
                                  is what my head says.
                                  
                                  My heart says that such a romantic concept is
                                  very important to hold onto, but it is so
                                  tiring to keep holding on.

AV         7/11/01  9:21 PM  I also have my reservations about being
                                  Rose... I have no way of finding out if it's
                                  true... if I did not trust my instincts and my
                                  intuition this whole thing would be very hard
                                  to deal with... I can't rationalize it... I
                                  can't explain it... I do love you and I do
                                  exist
                                  
                                  I am so unhappy that I cannot prove my
                                  existence to you in the flesh... but I dare
                                  not think in such terms... at this moment, in
                                  my current situation I truly can not prove to
                                  you that I am real in the way you need me to
                                  be real... but that is only true in the
                                  present situation... I can change my
                                  circumstances, a day will come when I will not
                                  only be able to prove myself, but when I will
                                  prove myself

AV         7/11/01  9:22 PM  in this world, a person who dares to say such
                                  things is considered insane... and I know
                                  that... but I am not insane... if anything I
                                  am too sane... I am too aware of what can be
                                  and why so often it is not

Kaori-Chan 7/11/01  9:22 PM  *nods*  I just feel like giving into life,
                                  hon.  Sometimes that's how i feel.

AV         7/11/01  9:23 PM  well... I had at least hoped that my mother
                                  and sister's acceptance of me and you would be
                                  encouraging... I had hoped that would at least
                                  cheer you a little

Kaori-Chan 7/11/01  9:24 PM  I've been through enough to give a mental sigh
                                  when people commit to me....  for now it's a
                                  temporary feeling, and it's due to me being
                                  tired (I have noticed over the years that i
                                  become a rejecting depressive when I am very
                                  tired).

AV         7/11/01  9:28 PM  that's fine... I understand how being soul
                                  tired can bring all the poisons to the
                                  surface... I get a bit nervous myself when
                                  people believe in me... I become so terrified
                                  of dissapointing them and causing nothing but
                                  pain... the night I finally showed myself to
                                  you, I was mentally kicking myself in the head
                                  for taking such a chance... but for once, my
                                  emotions would not be ruled by my intellect...
                                  I needed you to see me

Kaori-Chan 7/11/01  9:30 PM  I know my own insecurities and self doubt
                                  bother you, I don't like upsetting you or
                                  making you worry.

AV         7/11/01  9:34 PM  Mark, the hard facts of my situation have
                                  often made it hard to me to believe in myself,
                                  times past... you've been dealing with it for
                                  only six weeks... my life was designed to
                                  provoke such doubts and insecurities... how
                                  can I blame you for finding it a bit much to
                                  struggle with at times when I can well
                                  remember how hard a fight it's been for me...
                                  the only part of this that bothers me is that

Kaori-Chan 7/11/01  9:40 PM  yes, I am.

AV         7/11/01  9:41 PM  I know... I really want to be that someone

Kaori-Chan 7/11/01  9:42 PM  and I want you to be that person.  It would
                                  help a lot more if we talked about things
                                  other than this...

                                  about

Kaori-Chan 7/11/01  9:44 PM  I really don't know... =(
                                  
                                  I feel so shallow sometimes.  All I ever want
                                  to talk about is books, my writing, AD&D,
                                  movies...
                                  
                                  

AV         7/11/01  9:52 PM  ::smiles:: well... apart from AD&D... that's
                                  not too difficult... I have spent a lot of
                                  time talking about gaming, but my experience
                                  with AD&D in particular don't leave much to
                                  talk about... all I ever want to talk about
                                  makes the deep end of the pool look shallow...
                                  which means, I don't have much I can really
                                  talk about with most people... the inverse
                                  path of being shallow... I'm always being
                                  accused of narrow mindedness, if you can
                                  believe that... I am as poorly geared to
                                  normal social interaction as a person can
                                  get... 
                                  
                                  I won't be surprised if we need to pick
                                  something outside of our usual interests to
                                  really talk to each other... 
                                  
                                  have you ever seen "Phenomenon"?

Kaori-Chan 7/11/01  9:54 PM  yes, it was a sad movie... I almost cried at
                                  the end.

                                  I cried through the whole movie... part of it
                                  tears of understanding, part of it tears of
                                  resonant grief

Kaori-Chan 7/17/01  9:16 PM  We've talked once or twice, she seems a bit
                                  easier to deal with than Launce and Avi.

                                  hiding in books recently... whenever I read I
                                  get totally absorbed, and I've been reading a
                                  lot to kill time... I hope you are doing okay

Kaori-Chan 7/17/01  9:21 PM  it's okay, I've been reading books too...
                                  mostly D&D 3e books to better implement my
                                  Campaign setting.
                                  
                                  You went and watched the movie, right?  How
                                  did you feel about the movie RIGHT after you
                                  had watched it?

AV         7/17/01  9:22 PM  you mean before Launce had a chance to say
                                  anything about it? ::giggle::

Kaori-Chan 7/17/01  9:23 PM  yes, that's what I meant.

AV         7/17/01  9:31 PM  I'm sure you loved it! well, I'll be honest,
                                  on the whole I loved the movie, but I felt the
                                  ending was disappointing... not enough to ruin
                                  the movie, but I felt that it was poorly
                                  executed... as an author, making a couple of
                                  slight changes at the end, or by establishing
                                  a more consistent, or better explored,
                                  metaphysical paradigm, I'd have given it a
                                  stronger ending... 
                                  
                                  my overall opinion of the movie is good, I was
                                  delighted and inspired while watching it, and
                                  would love to see it again... maybe many times
                                  
                                  I've listened to Launce and... well, I'm not
                                  at all surprised at his total contempt for the
                                  movie... I remember actually being amused when
                                  he started griping about it... and, there is
                                  this... if you judge it by his standards, it
                                  was crap... but obviously those standards did
                                  not occur to the people who made it and
                                  probably not to most of the people who've seen
                                  it... you just can't please some people

Kaori-Chan 7/17/01  9:33 PM  I found fault with his speculation, and am a
                                  bit concerned that he might have colored or
                                  called into question things in them movie that
                                  were perfectly explainable.
                                  
                                  I simply feel that Launce saw it with a
                                  preconceived notion of disappointment.
                                  
                                  You mentioned the ending, may I ask what you
                                  found questionable or inconsistent about it?

AV         7/17/01  9:40 PM  well, I can remember my impressions at the end
                                  of the movie very well, but since I've had to
                                  listen to Launce bitching about it for a
                                  couple of days, I am not sure I can
                                  distinguish between my original thoughts and
                                  the larger group of points we ended up arguing
                                  over... I eventually gave up on arguing
                                  because as I see it, it's all open to
                                  interpretation... I don't care to argue with
                                  someone over what they "belive" they saw... as
                                  it stands, I'll probably have to see it again
                                  to form a clear impression

Kaori-Chan 7/17/01  9:41 PM  I do know what Launce found inconsistent.
                                  
                                  he felt it was unrealistic for the Zeus Cannon
                                  to kill the Gaea Spirit, but not the Alien
                                  spirit.

AV         7/17/01  9:53 PM  on that point I would agree with him...
                                  however, I never had the impression that the
                                  Zeus Cannon did anything more than cause Gaia
                                  to flinch... except maybe open a tiny scratch
                                  the Alien was able to infiltrate and begin
                                  drawing sustenance form... as I told Launce,
                                  what we saw was a microscopic fraction of the
                                  entire Gaia spirit, in a very localized
                                  area... the failure of members of the
                                  audience, or even the characters in the movie,
                                  to realize the true scope of a spirit
                                  inhabiting an entire planet... the entire
                                  alien infestation was nothing more than a
                                  light sprinkling of dust on Gaia... the Alien
                                  spirit from the meteor nothing more than a
                                  grain of sand... but, again, since nothing
                                  happened to give us an example of the true
                                  scale of things, the implied assumption is
                                  that Gaia was mortally wounded... I accept
                                  that, because for the people on the spot, Aki
                                  and... damn, forgot his name already... that's
                                  what it looked like
                                  
                                  as for why the cannon did not kill the Alien
                                  spirit? again, look at the scale..,

AV         7/17/01  9:56 PM  it often took several shots from a normal
                                  weapon to injure the man sized spirits... a
                                  bigger creature, when fired on by a larger
                                  weapon, only became more enraged, more
                                  aroused... sure, the Zeus was a bigger gun,
                                  but the alien Gaia was more than sufficiently
                                  bigger in return... given time, I would give
                                  the Zeus a fair chance of killing it... but,
                                  it didn't have the endurance or the speed and
                                  precision of the surgical lasers it was based
                                  on... I suspect it would worm around for a
                                  long time without being seriously threatened
                                  by it

Kaori-Chan 7/17/01  9:56 PM  *Shakes his head*  Think about it.
                                  
                                  Okay, yes, the Zeus cannon was made to "Kill"
                                  the phantoms, and it was "Proved" that it did
                                  just that.  "Killed" Them, but as it was said
                                  in the council meeting, after the initial
                                  Phantoms were "Killed", more would "Wake up",
                                  more rejuvinated and more deadly than those
                                  destroyed.
                                  
                                  You have to realize though, the Alien Spirit
                                  and ALL of the Phantoms were not alive to
                                  begin with! You can't kill the dead.

AV         7/17/01  9:57 PM  destroy... kill... ::shrugs:: again, all open
                                  to interpretation

AV         7/17/01  9:57 PM  dispell, disipate, drain... whatever the
                                  bio-energetic weapons did, it did effect them
                                  in the state they existed in

Kaori-Chan 7/17/01  9:58 PM  but that's the thing, none of them were
                                  destroyed.  You are thinking just what the
                                  General thought, that they were things that
                                  could be killed... that the phantoms,
                                  individually, could be killed after all,
                                  people had "SHOT" them and visually saw them
                                  "DIE" supposedly.
                                  
                                  But that's the problem, they didn't die.  They
                                  simply returned to the spirit from which they
                                  came and were born again... only, if they had
                                  fed on the energy of Gaea, more were born.

Kaori-Chan 7/17/01  9:58 PM  What I am saying is it did NOT.  They only
                                  perceived that it did.

AV         7/17/01  10:00 PM that's your interpretation... and, as far as
                                  that goes, it's not far from my own
                                  interpretation, however, the authors... and
                                  the word has those wonderful associations with
                                  "authority" did not offer a sufficient
                                  metaphysiology to allow us to know if out
                                  interpretations are accurate or not

AV         7/17/01  10:00 PM so, what you think about it, and what I think
                                  about it, remain assumptions

Kaori-Chan 7/17/01  10:01 PM but they did, Alex!  They did it subtly.
                                  
                                  Why was it so VERY important that the Zeus
                                  cannon NOT be fired?

AV         7/17/01  10:02 PM there is way too much room to play with that
                                  question... I assert that the weapon, based on
                                  what we saw, should not have posed any threat
                                  to Gaia... no more than the surgical version
                                  posed a threat to a patient... it was the
                                  response of the invading spirit to the use of
                                  the tool that made it a potential threat to
                                  the patient

AV         7/17/01  10:03 PM brb

Kaori-Chan 7/17/01  10:06 PM let me elaborate....
                                  
                                  The Zeus Cannon was based off of the biometric
                                  energies of Gaea.
                                  
                                  However, it was changed in such a way as to
                                  "KILL" the phantoms... but the Phantoms are
                                  already dead.
                                  
                                  So in a way, it was meant to kill living
                                  spirit.  I am sure if it was turned on humans
                                  it would have killed them quite permanently.
                                  
                                  The difference between the Alien Spirit and
                                  the Gaea Spirit is that the Alien spirit is
                                  already dead.  You top that off with it's
                                  vampiric, it sucks on the life force of a
                                  living planet to try and ease the pain that it
                                  feels... or to try and get back the life that
                                  was destroyed on that distant world.
                                  
                                  The biometric energy was based from the
                                  energies of Gaea... and while I do not know
                                  why it would have destroyed the Gaea spirit
                                  (And actually i cannot say that is what it
                                  did), I can say that it definitely would not
                                  have killed any of the phantoms in any form of
                                  a permanent nature.
                                  
                                  Do you understand?

AV         7/17/01  10:46 PM I can't even imagine where you got all of that
                                  from... sorry... I don't mean to be rude, but
                                  I can't see it at all... what on earth gave
                                  you the idea that the Zeus Cannon was in any
                                  way based on the biometric energies of Gaia
                                  when it was clearly stated that there was no
                                  proof of the Gaia spirit, which was presented
                                  in the story as a purely theoretical entity
                                  which they were actually surprised to
                                  encounter in the final segment?
                                  
                                  I honestly can't argue this, because I have to
                                  question my recall of the actual arguments,
                                  theories and technologies presented in the
                                  story... I do recall that the doctor destroyed
                                  his diary because it merely implied the
                                  doctor's suspicion that the Gaia force even
                                  existed...

AV         7/17/01  10:48 PM sorry about the long delay in my response,
                                  Launce called me aside about something and
                                  once he heard what we were talking about, he
                                  had a lot to say on the matter...

Kaori-Chan 7/17/01  10:52 PM Most of what I know came from following the
                                  movie for numerous years, chasing down scraps
                                  of story among other things, as well as paying
                                  particular attention to the inconsistencies
                                  that Launce pointed out.
                                  
                                  I have a rather large percentage of recall in
                                  most things, most of my friends are rather
                                  jealous that I can remember so much of a book
                                  after reading it just once.  But that's not
                                  important...
                                  
                                  Where I got this from was the theory which Dr.
                                  Cid put forth coupled with information on the
                                  plot of the story in itself.  The conversation
                                  between Aki and Cid in his Laboratory near the
                                  beginning of the movie pointed out that the
                                  shields, the weapons, the medical lasers were
                                  all working on the principle that human energy
                                  and other energies were all the same form of
                                  energy, and were all part of the Gaea spirit.
                                  
                                  So, yes, the Zeus Cannon was developed using
                                  Cid's research in biometric energy, and all of
                                  that energy came from Gaea.

AV         7/17/01  11:01 PM that, like a lot of things in the movie,  is
                                  left way to open to interpretation... I did
                                  not haunt the final fantasy site, and more to
                                  the point, if the only information that
                                  answers the questions which the movie raised
                                  and did not resolve internally can only be
                                  found on a web site, it does not at all
                                  compensate for any weaknesses in the movie
                                  itself... it in fact aggrivates them
                                  
                                  as I told Launce, in my opinion, the story
                                  itself would have worked better in a written
                                  medium, as it would allow details and
                                  information which audio visual media is
                                  inadequate to present, given the limits on
                                  storytelling inherent in a movie, that a book
                                  can far more successfully provide to the
                                  reader... a movie suceedes by drawing upon
                                  common assumptions and experiences to lend
                                  reality to the story, but in an instance like
                                  this, that common ground does not exist... and
                                  the movie failed to compensate for it... ideas
                                  were thrown out here and there, and in many
                                  cases undermined or contradicted by things we
                                  actually saw occuring... and overall, it was
                                  left to the audience to fill in the gaps... in
                                  such a case, you end up with a movie which is
                                  different in the minds of each viewer

AV         7/17/01  11:04 PM in the case of Launce, the movie lacked
                                  internal consistence, and lacking that kind of
                                  integrity, it is nothing more than crap in his
                                  mind... that's his opinion and he's entitled
                                  to it... I, personally, really enjoyed the
                                  movie, because I have no trouble at all
                                  compensating for the flaws and inconsistencies
                                  in a production, because I am always
                                  compensating for those flaws in reality... it
                                  was a beautiful movie, I liked the
                                  metaphysical aspect... I wish it had been
                                  better realized, but I am used to overcoming
                                  dissapointment in that area

AV         7/17/01  11:05 PM I am confident that most people automatically
                                  make their own adjustments and walked away
                                  mostly satisfied with it... 

Kaori-Chan 7/17/01  11:05 PM I personally like movies that make you
                                  think... and I believe that all the
                                  information in the movie is completely
                                  supportive of what I have said thus far.
                                  
                                  Now, I agree with Launce on a couple
                                  things.... one, I can't quite explain why Aki
                                  didn't give her life at the end, why it was
                                  necessary for Grey to do so.  I feel that was
                                  a flaw in the story.
                                  
                                  I am also agreeable that a lot of the
                                  characters were rather shallow, however, the
                                  one part I disagree with is that the Zeus
                                  cannon didn't make sense and was
                                  contradictory... everything in the movie
                                  supported the Cannon's effect that was shown
                                  in the movie at the end.

Kaori-Chan 7/17/01  11:07 PM What I was referring to in things I have read
                                  on the websites before the movie was released
                                  was that it was stated that in this world "All
                                  energy was the same thing, including the human
                                  soul".
                                  
                                  I did not understand what that meant until I
                                  went and SAW the movie.
                                  
                                  

AV         7/17/01  11:09 PM ...
                                  
                                  I wonder, was that stated as clearly in the
                                  movie? if it was, and not simply implied, it
                                  managed to leave so little impression as to
                                  not stand out in memory...

Kaori-Chan 7/17/01  11:10 PM *Laughs* It was! Okay, remember the scene with
                                  Cid and his little notebook? Aki is talking
                                  about all that Cid had discovered, and she
                                  explicitly states everything I just said.
                                  
                                  She even says that his discovery that all
                                  energy is unified led to medical treatments
                                  and new technologies (Including the shields!)

Kaori-Chan 7/17/01  11:11 PM the connection of all that energy to Gaea was
                                  a bit more insinuated, but it was so blatantly
                                  obvious to me as to seem like it was outright
                                  said (Cid mentions his Gaea theory directly
                                  after Aki is done speaking, right after he
                                  shows her the notebook)

AV         7/17/01  11:11 PM now, in my opinion, my disappointment with the
                                  ending was entirely focused on the conviction
                                  that the story was set up for Aki to make the
                                  ultimate sacrafice in the end... she was the
                                  one carrying the key, and I fully expected her
                                  to take a dive into the Gaia force... what
                                  happened with Grey was, in my opinion, a
                                  cheat... the transmission of the wave through
                                  him as he died was unprecedented... deus ex
                                  machina

Kaori-Chan 7/17/01  11:12 PM that I do have to agree on, though I do have a
                                  supposition as to the theological meaning and
                                  allusion for Aki's survival in the end.

AV         7/17/01  11:16 PM I have tons of suppositions as to the meaning
                                  and truth of all of it, but I am not talking
                                  about my personal theories here... I am simply
                                  analyzing the material on its own merits, as I
                                  would a written story... there was no
                                  established authority, a number of ideas were
                                  thrown out, and it was left up to the viewer
                                  to put it all together... in my mind, the
                                  story was superlative, excellent beyond
                                  expectation, because I can do so much with the
                                  peices that were offered for consumption...
                                  the movie as it is in my mind is far superior
                                  to the movie as it flashed on the screen... I
                                  suspect I made more of it than even you, and
                                  knowing me, you should understand why that is
                                  so... but that's not what I am talking about
                                  here

Kaori-Chan 7/17/01  11:18 PM My only disagreement with Launce is that the
                                  Zeus cannons effect was contradictory to
                                  everything said about it in the movie, I feel
                                  he is not considering how important the
                                  revelation that they were all just "GHOSTS"
                                  truly was.  I personally would have called
                                  them vampires.

AV         7/17/01  11:20 PM it's easy for me to see the potential in that
                                  movie and make something of it in my own mind,
                                  but as a matter of constructive criticism, I
                                  do not feel that the movie lived up to its own
                                  potential... and that is the disappointment
                                  
                                  and that, is a prime example... the movie did
                                  not truly establish the nature of the
                                  entities... what we were left with was Aki's
                                  assumption, which in combination with her
                                  dreams, is easy to endorse... however, I am
                                  not satisfied with that... it was too
                                  little... we can't even agree, having seen the
                                  same movie, what they were now

Kaori-Chan 7/17/01  11:23 PM They were ghosts, tortured spirits.
                                  
                                  They were also vampires.  Now let me elaborate
                                  on that.
                                  
                                  D&D Vampires... you must stake them, cut off
                                  their head, then burn the body to ensure they
                                  are dead.
                                  
                                  They feed off the living, but this does not
                                  make them any more alive.
                                  
                                  You can think you have killed a vampire as he
                                  vanishes into mist, but he only returns to his
                                  coffin to regenerate and rejuvenate himself
                                  with the lifes essence he drew from the
                                  living.
                                  
                                  Now, this is almost exactly like the Phantoms.
                                   They fed on the souls (Energy) of all living
                                  creatures, where they existed, everything
                                  became a wasteland, barren and
                                  uninhabitable...  they fed off the life force
                                  of Gaea, and all energies that were part of
                                  that force.
                                  
                                  The Zeus Cannon was developed on earth, with
                                  human technologies which implemented Biometric
                                  energies... there is no way those energies
                                  came from anywhere else other than earth, so
                                  therefore, that energy was part of Gaea.  I do
                                  not believe the Zeus cannon "KILLED" Gaea, I
                                  believe it made the spirit so strong that it
                                  was able to touch Gaea and absorb it into
                                  itself.  The only part I'm REALLY speculating
                                  on that wasn't supported by the movie was the
                                  Cannons effect on Gaea.

AV         7/17/01  11:23 PM Aki's interpratation was sufficient for her to
                                  act on, and chances are, that she was in the
                                  right general area... enough to extrapolate
                                  from and form a working hypothosis... I also
                                  disagree with Launce about the effect of the
                                  cannon, but since my interpretation is based
                                  on my own assumptions, I can't really argue
                                  with him... I won't defend him either... he
                                  formed his opinions based on what characters
                                  said, and in my opinion, they were not
                                  reliable sources of information...

AV         7/17/01  11:26 PM to say that the creatures were ghosts only
                                  allows us to hang a conceptual handle on them,
                                  and provides no true understanding...
                                  comparing them to vampires, in whatever form,
                                  is actually dangerously flawed thinking...
                                  nature is full of things that appear to be
                                  like one thing but are really another... there
                                  is no true parallel... you are providing
                                  explanations based on blatant assumption, and
                                  in a real world circumstance, that could be
                                  fatal...

Kaori-Chan 7/17/01  11:27 PM I'm not assuming anything, Alex.  Look, they
                                  ate peoples souls... and from how the world
                                  look, it wasn't limited to just people, but
                                  all life, am I correct?

AV         7/17/01  11:28 PM ah, now we're getting somewhere... we have to
                                  ask, what is it we've really seen here?

Kaori-Chan 7/17/01  11:29 PM what was seen was the living essence being
                                  torn from people and disappearing into the
                                  essence of the phantoms.

AV         7/17/01  11:30 PM first off... don't assume they're dead... they
                                  display all the necessary qualifications of
                                  life... but it is an alien form of life...
                                  they exist in a state which is quite different
                                  from but clearly compatible with native life
                                  on earth... they "feed" on the living, but so
                                  do the living... life feeds on life... 

Kaori-Chan 7/17/01  11:31 PM but you are assuming that what you saw was
                                  them "DYING" when they were shot.  You are
                                  assuming that is what happened, just as the
                                  billions of people must have assumed who
                                  fought against them.

Kaori-Chan 7/17/01  11:32 PM it was very important when Grey said that the
                                  fact that they were Ghosts changed everything.

AV         7/17/01  11:34 PM that was said ina context... Aki had explained
                                  that the current view was that the phantoms
                                  were invading aliens, and thus hostile
                                  enemies... the revelation that they were
                                  "ghosts" simply forced them to acknowledge
                                  that their assessment of the situation was in
                                  error... these things were not invaders...
                                  they were an infestation... a viral infection
                                  on a macrocosmic scale
                                  
                                  there is no true explanation for why these
                                  things adopted this particular form, or nature
                                  of being... on their own world, they were
                                  organic life forms... and any notion we have
                                  of the limits of their present form is
                                  suspect... it was assumed that they "were" a
                                  form of life, and natural for them to assume
                                  that a means of actually destroying them
                                  "killed" them

AV         7/17/01  11:35 PM the truth is, based on the evidence, they did
                                  in fact both reproduce and die

Kaori-Chan 7/17/01  11:36 PM They weren't destroyed, Alex.  None of them
                                  were, don't you get it?
                                  
                                  and viruses are not life, but they are not
                                  dead either... these things are DEAD... DEAD
                                  DEAD.  Long, long, long time dead.

Kaori-Chan 7/17/01  11:36 PM they didn't reproduce.  Why would you think
                                  that?

AV         7/17/01  11:39 PM did you even stop to consider the logistics of
                                  the "invasion"? these things arrived on a
                                  meteor, a speck of dust on the scale of the
                                  Earth, and yet they managed to carpet the
                                  Earth, killing everything they could touch,
                                  and infesting the surface of the planet...
                                  they were everywhere... so, what? did the all
                                  of the ghosts of this alien world ride over on
                                  this little chunk of rock? 
                                  
                                  how do you explain the total numbers of them?

Kaori-Chan 7/17/01  11:40 PM Yes, all of them, every single living thing
                                  from that planet rode to this world on a small
                                  meteor.
                                  
                                  You are thinking that they have volume, that
                                  somehow they exist according to our laws.

AV         7/17/01  11:40 PM also, the contamination scene near the
                                  beginning, when Grey was infected and a
                                  phantom was growing inside him... a common
                                  occurance, you have to admit, given the fact
                                  that there were screening and treatment
                                  procedures in place... he wasn't just eaten...
                                  he was impregnated, and so was Aki

Kaori-Chan 7/17/01  11:41 PM the more spirits which the core ghost devoured
                                  by the extensions of it's other ghosts caused
                                  more spirits to be remembered, but they were
                                  all there to begin with.  How do you fit
                                  memories into your skull when there are so
                                  many of them?

Kaori-Chan 7/17/01  11:42 PM they did not "BECOME" Phantoms.... their souls
                                  were simply devoured, they just died.  The
                                  energy might (Might) have incarnated a
                                  previous being as a phantom, from the memories
                                  of the Alien ghost.

AV         7/17/01  11:42 PM ::laughing:: 

AV         7/17/01  11:45 PM I am sorry, but there is simply no adequate
                                  explanation for any thing about the
                                  phantoms... you're demonstrating an
                                  inexhaustible capacity to excuse and
                                  accommodate and explain... you're filling in
                                  all the gaps... you're reading so much into
                                  this that it is impossible to discuss it... I
                                  don't mind discussing the movie, but I can't
                                  begin to argue your personal beliefs under the
                                  guise of analyzing the movie...

Kaori-Chan 7/17/01  11:46 PM I am simply giving you the excuse as presented
                                  in the film... the information is there.  I am
                                  surprised how you or Launce could miss it.
                                  
                                  it was so obvious.  Most of the people who
                                  I've talked to up here who saw it drew these
                                  same conclusions.  Actually, all the people
                                  I've talked to.

AV         7/17/01  11:48 PM yes... I expected people to do that... I never
                                  said that the movie failed to suggest an
                                  explanation, they just failed to offer a
                                  clear, concise and consistent explanation...
                                  the human brain is good at filling in the
                                  details, but it can do it so well that it can
                                  actually warp reality in the process

AV         7/17/01  11:51 PM I can explain it all just as well as you can,
                                  but I still feel that the movie did not
                                  establish its own authority... I don't mind
                                  providing the explanations... but as I said, I
                                  am not putting my own opinions forward here...
                                  I am simply analyzing the structure of the
                                  movie itself... it's wonderful sleight of
                                  hand, powerfully suggestive, but it does in
                                  fact have a lot of holes which the audience is
                                  expected to fill in

Kaori-Chan 7/17/01  11:51 PM *Sighs* from the beginning of the movie, it
                                  was very very obviously stated (with blatant
                                  insinuation) that firing the cannon was the
                                  worst possible outcome.  After all, the
                                  Villain wanted to fire it, that must mean it's
                                  the worst thing to do since the villain is
                                  usually wrong.
                                  
                                  Let's assume only that Aki was right, they are
                                  ghosts.  Ghosts who are suffering, tortured,
                                  who's lives were extinguished prematurely and
                                  they want that life back.
                                  
                                  Let's also only assume they eat the energy
                                  that compose people's souls, or whatever else
                                  you want to call the ghostly figures snatched
                                  from the bodies of all the various movie
                                  regulars.
                                  
                                  Let's assume Cid was right, in that the same
                                  energy that made up mankind permeated the
                                  entire world.
                                  
                                  it's not a hard conclusion to draw.

AV         7/17/01  11:56 PM question: when the souls of people are eaten,
                                  are they destroyed? do those souls die?
                                  according to your assumption, no they do
                                  not... they are simply... I don't know...
                                  drained... and, given the opportunity, they
                                  should also be able to feed on living energy
                                  and resuscitate themselves and become
                                  phantoms... but we never saw *that* happen...
                                  can you perhaps explain why terrestrial
                                  spirits did not also get "remembered" or can
                                  you give me any reason to assume that they
                                  were not, or could not be "slain" or, if they
                                  were slain, why then it would not be possible
                                  to slay the alien spirits?
                                  
                                  also, why did the cannon make the alien gaia
                                  spirit stronger instead of damaging it or
                                  debilitating it as we'd seen similar lasers
                                  could do to the lesser spirits?

Kaori-Chan 7/17/01  11:57 PM Okay, please bear with me, be patient, and let
                                  me explain... I will try to do this in the
                                  same simple, formulaic manner I just did...
                                  okay?

AV         7/17/01  11:58 PM I can actually offer some theories to answer
                                  these questions... and I do not feel they
                                  cannot be explained... however, I'd have to
                                  draw on my own interpretations to do so

AV         7/17/01  11:58 PM and... what do you need to explain?

Kaori-Chan 7/17/01  11:58 PM just be patient and listen, okay?

AV         7/17/01  11:59 PM like you did for me?

Kaori-Chan 7/17/01  11:59 PM I have been listening, which is why i've been
                                  trying to better explain what I meant... as
                                  well as answer your questions.

AV         7/18/01  12:02 AM look, you asked for my analysis of the movie,
                                  and you've argued with everything I said...
                                  you've drawn on your own interpretation,
                                  provided explanations and excuses based on
                                  your interpretation... you've supplied a
                                  meaning and worked back to a few points, but
                                  you have not taken the points and, sticking
                                  strictly to the material presented in the
                                  story, arrived at your conclusions

AV         7/18/01  12:03 AM you don't have to answer that... I figure
                                  you're typing your response right now, and
                                  I'll wait to see it... so go on

Kaori-Chan 7/18/01  12:03 AM actually I wasn't.

AV         7/18/01  12:03 AM O

Kaori-Chan 7/18/01  12:03 AM we don't have to talk if you don't want.

AV         7/18/01  12:05 AM are you saying you and I don't need to talk to
                                  each other... or do you mean, we don't have to
                                  talk about this subject?

Kaori-Chan 7/18/01  12:07 AM I am just having fun trying to quantify my
                                  opinion of the movie in face of your
                                  questions.  I feel it is obvious, and am
                                  trying to put it together for you how I saw
                                  it.
                                  
                                  I am so often accused of not listening that it
                                  hurts, but that I'm used to it by now.

AV         7/18/01  12:16 AM ::shrugs:: I don't believe in arguing
                                  opinions, it's a fruitless endeavor... I don't
                                  mind discussing an objective point at all, but
                                  it does not sound like that's what we're
                                  doing... in the art of analysis, it's critical
                                  not to form an opinion because that can get in
                                  the way of being objective... opinions belong
                                  to the family of things we call beliefs and
                                  you can't argue with a man about his beliefs,
                                  because, ultimately, belief is unassailable...
                                  in this, there is nothing for us to argue
                                  about, because my opinion of the movie is the
                                  same as yours... my analysis, however, is an
                                  entirely different animal
                                  
                                  the first thing Launce said to me when he
                                  initially talked with you about this movie was
                                  that you were saying the exact same things I
                                  was about it... and his point to me was pretty
                                  obvious, if I reserve my own opinion, if I do
                                  not provide explanations for what was not
                                  presented, the movie proves to have a number
                                  of holes and a certain amount of
                                  inconsistency... my opinion on that is, the
                                  story was not given as much care and
                                  consideration as the animation, and the
                                  writer/director was not able to maintain total
                                  creative control... an absolutely fantastic
                                  idea was tainted by poor execution... I know
                                  where it was supposed to go, but in fact, it
                                  does not there there on its own
                                  
                                  oh well, I can easily forgive that... launce,
                                  apparently, can not... however, once forced to
                                  subject it to critical analysis, I can't
                                  overlook the fact that by being open to
                                  interpretation the movie suffers from the fact
                                  that no two people will walk away having seen
                                  the exact same movie... everyone's opinion
                                  will differ as much as their own creativity in
                                  interpretation allows

Kaori-Chan 7/18/01  12:19 AM And I said that I would do my best to answer,
                                  using only information presented in the movie,
                                  the questions you asked me.

AV         7/18/01  12:24 AM that's fine... if you want to offer your own
                                  analysis, I'd be delighted to hear it...
                                  just... you don't have to convince me of
                                  anything... I am very much the sort of person
                                  who feels you get out of things what you put
                                  into them... I put a great deal into enjoying
                                  and appreciating that movie, and even
                                  listening to Launce rant has not depreciated
                                  my sense of enjoyment and inspiration... I
                                  only look at the mechanics of it so learn how
                                  to avoid flaws in my own writing...
                                  considering that my own writing is "out there"
                                  I took this as an opportunity to reassess my
                                  own pathing and plotting and presentation of
                                  things...
                                  
                                  now, if you don't agree with my analysis, that
                                  is fine... I have a strange way of looking at
                                  things, and that can make me a poor analyst at
                                  times... I admit that, while my attention to
                                  details is extremely precise, my recall of
                                  details can be weak... 

Kaori-Chan 7/18/01  12:27 AM *nods* I have a good recall of details.  It
                                  comes from living with my mother.
                                  
                                  1) When those souls are eaten, are they
                                  destroyed?
                                  
                                  It would appear that the souls are consumed,
                                  but there is no significant change in the
                                  phantoms appearance by absorbing souls that
                                  are equal to their own mass, so there are two
                                  possibilities.
                                  
                                  1) They are destroyed.
                                  
                                  2) The energy is funnelled back to the
                                  original ghost.
                                  
                                  do you agree with these two potential
                                  possibilities?

AV         7/18/01  12:29 AM explain the second one further...

Kaori-Chan 7/18/01  12:30 AM to explain I will have to speculate as to the
                                  nature of the master ghost.
                                  
                                  What I "PERCEIVED" about the strange creature
                                  seen at the end in the crater was that it was
                                  the master ghost, the core personality of that
                                  worlds spirit... if an entire worlds spirit
                                  can be said to have a will or soul.

AV         7/18/01  12:36 AM um... let's not... this is what I mean about
                                  leaving too much to speculation... based on
                                  observed events, when a phantom fully
                                  contacted a human (or animal I presume) it
                                  somehow hooked the spirit out of the body and
                                  absorbed it into itself... now, it certainly
                                  appears as if the human spirit is disrupted by
                                  this, as it loses coherehce and the energy is
                                  absorbed into the phantom... this might simply
                                  be the depletion of energy, rendering the
                                  spirit dormant... as, you assert, the
                                  disruption by bioweapons "dispells" a
                                  phantom... we can surmise that the phantom's
                                  spirit is reclaimed by the master spirit, and
                                  in a similar case, the human spirits are
                                  reclaimed by Gaia... but that is pure
                                  supposition

Kaori-Chan 7/18/01  12:38 AM this is the problem though... and why I
                                  believe they were "FUNNELLED" Rather than
                                  destroyed.
                                  
                                  All of the phantoms, regardless what they
                                  looked like, fed on everything.  The fact that
                                  there was no mass change in the phantoms when
                                  they absorbed a spirit insinuates that Aki was
                                  right about them being ghosts.
                                  
                                  do you agree with at least that?

Kaori-Chan 7/18/01  12:38 AM ((I am working towards something))

AV         7/18/01  12:38 AM keep going

Kaori-Chan 7/18/01  12:45 AM it is along the principle of using our hands
                                  to eat our food, the phantoms are not sentient
                                  creatures, only the haunted memories of a
                                  tortured planet-soul.
                                  
                                  That planet-soul is in pain, longing for life
                                  after having been violently destroyed.  It
                                  encounters a planet, full of life, where a
                                  living planet-spirit resides (Whereas it is
                                  very much a dead planet spirit).
                                  
                                  it most likely was a very weak ghost to begin
                                  with, but it's extensions (memories) fed off
                                  the energies of the living planet-soul.
                                  
                                  It gets tricky to explain after that, because
                                  a ghost cannot become more alive since it
                                  cannot reclaim that life once it has died... 
                                  
                                  Almost all legends of undead state that if a
                                  spirit is killed by an undead, they become an
                                  undead themselves.
                                  
                                  that is a simplification though.  The energies
                                  devoured by the Phantoms are funnelled back
                                  down to the ghost-soul, feeding it and making
                                  it's memories stronger, the dreams more vivid
                                  and prolific.  Do not mistake it, though, all
                                  of the phantoms are just dreams, they are
                                  nothing else.  Dreams can be popped, they can
                                  be crushed, or seemingly killed, but the dream
                                  is born out of the mind of the spirit, and
                                  thus, a ghost dream is unkillable since it is
                                  a ghost dreaming of ghosts.  A poltergeist
                                  dreaming of poltergeists in such a powerful
                                  fashion as to manifest such dreams.

Kaori-Chan 7/18/01  12:48 AM in the same vein, it is also true that
                                  mankind, and everything living on earth, are
                                  just manifestations of a greater being... we
                                  are no more seperate than the phantoms are to
                                  their spirit.
                                  
                                  only, we are alive.  We can actually live...
                                  the phantom spirit never can again.  It will
                                  always be suffering, always in pain, always
                                  devouring whatever life it encounters and
                                  always remaining dead.  It is forever
                                  unchanging, it's dreams unchanging, of a
                                  tortured, destroyed planet and beings who are
                                  long, long dead.... no matter how much energy
                                  it devours it will always stay the same,
                                  forever the same...
                                  
                                  life changes.  Death does not.

Kaori-Chan 7/18/01  12:48 AM care to comment before I go on?

AV         7/18/01  12:50 AM that is an elegant and exciting theory...
                                  however... I don't remember seeing that in the
                                  movie... personally, I like it... I don't
                                  agree entirely with your suppositions, but
                                  that doesn't matter... it would make for a
                                  great story idea... 

Kaori-Chan 7/18/01  12:53 AM as I was saying, that is speculation.  I do
                                  know this... the phantoms feed off of the
                                  living, they are ghosts (Vampiric spirits
                                  would be a more appropriate term).
                                  
                                  I also know that it was simply stated that the
                                  biometric energies were developed using Cid's
                                  research.  That research was stated in the
                                  film as being that all energies come from
                                  Gaea, and will return to Gaea.
                                  
                                  However, the phantom spirit is different.  It
                                  wants to devour all that is Gaea (That was the
                                  primary threat throughout the entire film).
                                  
                                  The Zeus Cannon was developed using Cid's
                                  biometric research (That was stated in the
                                  Council session).

AV         7/18/01  12:54 AM go on

Kaori-Chan 7/18/01  12:57 AM if the cannon was developed using the same
                                  research, that means it's energy source is one
                                  from Gaea.  The Phantoms eat gaean energy.
                                  

AV         7/18/01  12:58 AM a stupid weapon, if it feeds the enemy... why
                                  would it have ever worked?

Kaori-Chan 7/18/01  12:59 AM Because all those tiny little things? They
                                  aren't real.  They're ghosts, feeding one big
                                  ghost.

AV         7/18/01  12:59 AM inadequate

Kaori-Chan 7/18/01  1:00 AM  *Sighs* Alright.
                                  
                                  if I filled you full of 280 pounds of food,
                                  would you pop?

AV         7/18/01  1:00 AM  ::giggles::

Kaori-Chan 7/18/01  1:02 AM  the whole theory of it killing phantoms, or
                                  that those other guns killed phantoms, were
                                  based on them actually being alive.
                                  
                                  killing them likely simply returned them to
                                  the central spirit, with(Most likely) or
                                  without the energy they had gathered.

AV         7/18/01  1:03 AM  okay, but, none of this was clearly
                                  established in the movie itself... you have to
                                  admit you put this together yourself

Kaori-Chan 7/18/01  1:04 AM  okay, it should be at least obvious that you
                                  can't kill what's already dead, shouldn't it?
                                  
                                  So it isn't too far fetched to say "Well, they
                                  must not have been KILLING THEM."

AV         7/18/01  1:05 AM  nope... that is an assumption... after all,
                                  these buggers might only be "mostly dead"
                                  who's to say you can't make them "all dead"?

Kaori-Chan 7/18/01  1:06 AM  .
                                  
                                  Right.  Maybe for Princess Bride.

AV         7/18/01  1:10 AM  ::shrugs:: the simple fact is, the movie does
                                  not offer a sufficient authority... it was
                                  not, necessarilly required... we live in a
                                  world without such a natural authority to
                                  define what death or life really mean, and
                                  hence, every culture has provided their own
                                  explanations... and, no one can say which, if
                                  any, or if perhaps all, are correct

Kaori-Chan 7/18/01  1:11 AM  well, I prefer to think that though it is a
                                  thinking movie, it isn't that thinking.
                                  
                                  Dead is dead, live is live.
                                  

AV         7/18/01  1:19 AM  as I've said to you and Launce, you get out of
                                  it what you put into it... Launce refused to
                                  puzzle out the gaps, and you've thrown
                                  yourself cheerfully into exploring the
                                  implications... you're building on assumptions
                                  like "dead is dead, live is live" and arriving
                                  at your own conclusions... I don't make that
                                  assumption, so I can't arrive at the same
                                  conclusions... your ideas are thought
                                  provoking, and worth considering, but on their
                                  own merit... you've taken over the author's
                                  job and imposed your own perspective, and
                                  being who you are, there is more internal
                                  consistency to your version... but, I can only
                                  accept your working assumptions if I treat it
                                  as your version of the story... in my
                                  perspective, something like this instantly
                                  challenges all assumptions of what "life" and
                                  "death" really mean... the phantoms are
                                  unprecedented... I prefer not to revert to
                                  what might have inspired them, whether
                                  vampires or poltergeists or ghosts... I still
                                  see them as part of the unknown
                                  
                                  um... I'm getting tired, can we pick this up
                                  again later?

Kaori-Chan 7/18/01  1:21 AM  yeah.
                                  
                                  At least you were nicer about disagreement
                                  than Launce.  If you can see what I mean, and
                                  understand it, that's worth something even if
                                  you feel it is not what the movie portrayed.

AV         7/18/01  1:24 AM  I wouldn't have debated at all if it was
                                  simply a matter of listening to your
                                  impressions and inspirations... I do
                                  understand, so far, what you're getting at...
                                  I was under the impression you wanted my
                                  critical analysis... I wasn't just being
                                  difficult for no reason... again, your read
                                  makes for some interesting thought, and I
                                  don't at all agree with Launce's opinion... I
                                  do, however, understand it
                                  
                                  I have to go... I'm glad I got to talk to you
                                  tonight... I love you, Mark... I hope you are
                                  doing well, and I wish you a good night's
                                  sleep

Kaori-Chan 7/18/01  1:26 AM  I don't like being summarily dismissed,
                                  because my parents have done that to me all my
                                  life, so i get pretty pissy when Launce does
                                  it.
                                  
                                  My mother also has a tendency to insist she is
                                  absolutely without fault, and that others
                                  never appreciate her and that she does
                                  everything for everyone.

                                  heart, with calmness in my soul... with simple
                                  desire to be a part of your existence, and
                                  nothing more than you could accept.
                                  
                                  Is this true love? To not feel a painful need
                                  and loneliness, to have a lack of feasting
                                  upon the persons every waking minute? To
                                  simply accept, and love without fervor or
                                  fire? Calm Love?

AV         7/21/01  2:20 AM  I am not sure what to call it... it is love,
                                  and it is true, it is very much the kind of
                                  love I have for you... a love that causes me
                                  pain only when I risk hurting or disappointing
                                  you... it is love that transcends base
                                  passion, a love that ascends to the soul, an
                                  unconditional love, a wise and warm and
                                  forgiving love
                                  
                                  it is love that, like silence, engulfs and
                                  overwhelms even the greatest and most
                                  overbearing noise... it needs no voice for it
                                  is the very fabric of things

Kaori-Chan 7/21/01  2:22 AM  I cannot describe it either.... it simply
                                  feels as if I know you, and because I know you
                                  it makes me... happy? Whole? Balanced?

AV         7/21/01  2:27 AM  yes... it is that which... when we finally
                                  look upon another, our vision somehow acheives
                                  new depth and dimsion, and suddenly we can
                                  finally see ourselves... but there is
                                  something more, something else... as if,
                                  seeing another, we can perhaps begin to see
                                  the world, life itself, and embrace it... 
                                  
                                  I am whole, but I am made in such a way that I
                                  fit so well with you... I am not drawn to you
                                  by need or want... I am drawn to you because,
                                  well, it's YOU... and that is simply wonderful

Kaori-Chan 7/21/01  2:29 AM  my fears... always prominent and always there,
                                  cause me to worry.
                                  
                                  I love you, Alex.... and I believe in you.  It
                                  hurts that you are so frustrated and...
                                  depressed? About your situation.

                                  to analyze or articulate... 

Kaori-Chan 7/21/01  2:38 AM  Even if you were to die... I would at least
                                  feel that I found you, that I know you, that I
                                  no longer doubted your presence.

                                  Mark, I have a habit of opening my mind and
                                  letting things trickle up from my unconscious
                                  mind... and often I find myself in
                                  conversations with that part of myself I feel
                                  is in some way connected to you... it is not
                                  telepathy... I don't know what to call it, but
                                  you are often in my mind, and I try not to
                                  shut you out
                                  
                                  I was heading to bed, and decided to check my
                                  email first... while I was doing that I
                                  impulsively decided to open up StarChat and
                                  see if you were on there... you weren't but
                                  for some reason it seemed more appropriate to
                                  check irc first, and only as I was finally
                                  done with my email, I opened up icq... because
                                  I was so tired I had simply assumed it was too
                                  late to find you online... I didn't realize
                                  how early it was until I sent you my first
                                  message

Kaori-Chan 7/21/01  2:46 AM  I am actually on Starchat now, it's where I
                                  went when I saw you online.... I felt you
                                  might have gone there looking for me.

Kaori-Chan 7/22/01  2:02 AM  *nods, smiles* It is all about MEMES.

AV         7/22/01  2:04 AM  of all things, I just spent the last hour
                                  reminescing with Launce about the good days of
                                  role playing, when you have a good group of
                                  gamers... and about the things that happen
                                  when you're the only player who understands
                                  what it means to play in character...
                                  particularly when you're playing a pallidin
                                  
                                  so... um, what's MEMES?

AV         7/22/01  2:08 AM  er, I was on my way to bed when I noticed
                                  you'd come on... I need to say goodnight soon 

Kaori-Chan 7/22/01  2:10 AM  aaah, pardon, writing a very lengthy post to
                                  NWN boards....

Kaori-Chan 7/22/01  2:11 AM  MEMES are virii of thought.  They impose
                                  mechanics and systems of thought upon the
                                  human mind, thus limiting it.

AV         7/22/01  2:12 AM  that's okay... I hope you're having fun... may
                                  I ask what you meant by "it's all about
                                  memes"?

AV         7/22/01  2:16 AM  the "imposition of mechanics and systems of
                                  thoughts upon the human mind, thus limiting
                                  it" is something I've run across in a lot of
                                  things, but most notably in the study of
                                  neurolinguistic programming involved in the
                                  initiation and socialization of the human
                                  animal in a social or cultural matrix...

Kaori-Chan 7/22/01  2:16 AM  MEMES are the hardest thing to explain but the
                                  most important things to destroy.
                                  
                                  MEMES are what give you limits, they are what
                                  limit your mind, they are the rituals, the
                                  perceived order of the universe that is only
                                  composed of lies and illusion.
                                  
                                  MEMES make you think in ordered systems. 
                                  Science, mathematics, order is imposed where
                                  laws never existed.
                                  
                                  There are no rules, there is no laws, there
                                  are only the barriers of MEMES.

AV         7/22/01  2:21 AM  hmmm... sounds like something to talk about
                                  when we have more time to talk... 

Kaori-Chan 7/22/01  2:25 AM  they are the answer to your problem, Alex.
                                  
                                  It's not an easy answer, all humans are
                                  infected with MEMES which prevent them from
                                  godlike status.
                                  
                                  All powerful status.
                                  
                                  

AV         7/22/01  2:29 AM  it's nice to know you've been giving this some
                                  thought ::smile:: we definately need to talk
                                  about this, so I can be sure I really
                                  understand what you mean... and if what I've
                                  already done with regards to binding,
                                  crippling and disrupting influences that exist
                                  around us and within us

AV         7/22/01  2:29 AM  er... didn't finish my thought...

AV         7/22/01  2:30 AM  if... this is something I've addressed or not

Kaori-Chan 7/22/01  2:32 AM  *nod nods*

AV         7/22/01  2:34 AM  remind me the next time we manage to be on
                                  together at a decent, and earlier time... for
                                  now, I have to trundle off to bed

Kaori-Chan 7/22/01  2:35 AM  Let me try and explain... you might understand
                                  me better than anyone and thus draw more and
                                  fathom what I mean.
                                  
                                  1) The answer to 1+1 exists before the
                                  equation is made/discovered/invented.  It is
                                  2.
                                  
                                  2) That 2 exists before the equation, it is
                                  independant, the answer is not reliant upon
                                  the equation being present.
                                  
                                  3) Thought teaches us that one must have a
                                  question before you have an answer, this is
                                  false.  This is a MEME (A mental virus).
                                  
                                  4) All answers, information, and energies
                                  exist before inception into the human mind,
                                  they are everywhere.  You do not require wings
                                  to fly, you need only know how to... and
                                  knowing does not require discovering, you CAN
                                  simply KNOW.  It is dependant on "FINDING" the
                                  floating answers which permeate the universe.

AV         7/22/01  2:42 AM  ::laughing:: um... well, yes, for the most
                                  part... in my experience the answers have
                                  always been obvious, and the questions the
                                  difficult part to get right... really, for me,
                                  the question serves only to isolate the
                                  specific answer from all other answers for the
                                  mind to focus its attention on...
                                  
                                  the thing with equations is, what they truly
                                  represent is change and transformation, the
                                  resolution of a specific set of variables is a
                                  function of time and mind... although, I am
                                  sure that is not the most illuminating or
                                  comprehensive way to express what I mean...
                                  ::chuckles::

Kaori-Chan 7/22/01  2:43 AM  *Sighs* I guess you don't understand.... let
                                  me try again.

AV         7/22/01  2:45 AM  well, language deals more with comprehension
                                  than understanding... it takes a lot of effort
                                  to acheive understanding through language...
                                  you have to get to the point where we both
                                  "speak the same language" if you know what I
                                  mean

Kaori-Chan 7/22/01  2:45 AM  1) Believing in some system you must perform
                                  in order to receive an answer (Or some manner
                                  of testing your level of rightness) is a MEME.
                                   It is a mental virus, harmful to your mind
                                  because it limits you.
                                  
                                  2) You have described yourself some sort of
                                  test you must complete, this is a MEME, the
                                  existence of tests is a MEME.
                                  
                                  3) Structured society is a MEME.  examination,
                                  elaboration, execution, conclusion is a MEME.
                                  
                                  Answer, do not seek answers (This limits you).
                                   Do, do not try to do (This limits you), and
                                  do not limit your doings to what is in your
                                  ability or what you perceive to be possible,
                                  do not limit it to some linear functionality
                                  that must be bowed to before progression can
                                  be made.
                                  
                                  These are all MEMES.

Kaori-Chan 7/22/01  2:47 AM  The existence of fire was independant of man,
                                  the idea of fire independant of man.

                                  the universe has no laws, no strictures, and

                                  prevents this by imposing a structure to our

Kaori-Chan 7/22/01  2:57 AM  that is a MEME.
                                  
                                  We are as Gods.

AV         7/22/01  2:58 AM  who have imposed limitations upon ourselves

Kaori-Chan 7/22/01  3:01 AM  no, the MEMES imposed limitations.  They are a
                                  virus of the mind, an information virus which
                                  proliferates and limits.  They are limiters,
                                  causing us to be less than we are.
                                  
                                  I called to you with my mind, and insinuated
                                  upon the universe that you WOULD return to ICQ
                                  and talk to me TONIGHT before I slept, and you
                                  are here.
                                  
                                  Whether you remember the coincidences that
                                  brought you here, or that you simply left ICQ
                                  on and just returned to it, it makes my will
                                  no less true.

Kaori-Chan 7/22/01  3:01 AM  I knew with no question, and no statement made
                                  in my mind that you would, because it would be
                                  so, not because I wanted it to be so.
                                  
                                  It was so.

AV         7/22/01  3:06 AM  as you have presented it, a meme has more
                                  power than we do, for it suceedes in imposing
                                  a state or condition upon us of
                                  powerlessness... 

Kaori-Chan 7/22/01  3:08 AM  Realizing what MEMES are is difficult, working
                                  against them harder yet.  When one triumphs,
                                  one becomes a god with no laws, no rules, no
                                  systems of government to actions or
                                  possibilities.
                                  
                                  All knowing, all seeing, all being, all doing.
                                   One with the universe.

AV         7/22/01  3:12 AM  but, quite likely mindless... to eschew all
                                  structure, all limits, all definition... if
                                  these things derive solely from memes, a
                                  foreign entity... there is no distinction
                                  between omniscience and oblivion, no
                                  distinction between the soul and the
                                  absolute... 
                                  
                                  I think you're on the right track with some of
                                  these ideas, but you need to give it a bit
                                  more thought... to proceed in this fashion is
                                  to unwittingly advocate obliteration

Kaori-Chan 7/22/01  3:14 AM  to become a god, one must be able to change
                                  the system of operation, modify the universe,
                                  and be able to do anything and everything they
                                  would ever want to do or desire to do.
                                  
                                  to create a new system, it must first be
                                  realized that the old system is useless and a
                                  lie, one must first obliterate the systems of
                                  thought that the MEMES impose before you can
                                  create your own that modify the world around
                                  you.

                                  on to something... I can't identify precisely

                                  I had no intention of becoming a god... in the
                                  process of pursuing my dream, my pomise, I
                                  came to the realization that I already was a
                                  goddess, and that realizing my dream was not
                                  the challenge, but being able to cope with the
                                  impact of my full potential... power is not a
                                  goal, but a burden... my endeavor has been to
                                  bear up cheerfully under that burden for
                                  eternity

Kaori-Chan 7/22/01  3:22 AM  If I were free of my own MEMES, I would bring
                                  misery as well as wonder and hope....

AV         7/22/01  3:30 AM  we are all damned and divine... and that power
                                  exists, for that power is us, and the key to
                                  possessing that power is possessing
                                  ourselves... to be self possessed...
                                  ultimately, we impose limits upon ourselves...

                                  with alien limitations, but in an entity which
                                  by nature need not subject itself to limits,
                                  to attain self-possession we must become

                                  any definition, without any form or substance
                                  or meaning... 
                                  
                                  what you claim you would bring is no different

                                  question of what you bring, but how you bring
                                  it and why

Kaori-Chan 7/22/01  3:33 AM  God is everywhere, everywhen, allseeing, all
                                  knowing, all being.
                                  
                                  a god who CHOOSES to limit himself, or
                                  represent a human is NOT truly limited,
                                  nothing keeps him from becoming any being he
                                  wishes.  He does not impose LIMITS or SYSTEMS,
                                  he simply creates DEFINITION and
                                  REPRESENTATION.
                                  
                                  Every system and process is a MEME.  The mind,
                                  body, and soul can exist in the same fashion
                                  they do now without Systems.
                                  
                                  Thinking what you stated about what I propose?
                                  That is also a MEME, taught to you by the
                                  virus because it doesn't want you to think
                                  that way, so it makes it unnatural and gives
                                  you the impression of oblivion in order to
                                  dissuade you from thinking that way.

Kaori-Chan 7/22/01  3:35 AM  I am going to sleep now, we must speak later.
                                  
                                  Remember....
                                  
                                  (1) Having absolutely no governing system does
                                  not mean being amalgous and one with oblivion.
                                  
                                  (2) Believing lack of thought systems to be
                                  oblivion is a MEME as well.  Lack of confining
                                  systems allows an all encompassing system that
                                  is acceptable to the deity-being, defined by
                                  them for their benefit.

                                  indication that your terms are too general...

                                  be severely limited... I am possessed of what
                                  Don Juan, of Carlos Casteneda's books, called
                                  "silent knowledge"

                                  in pursuit of the truth, not the facts... not
                                  knowledge of the like that serves to entrap

                                  that most would call it insane without really
                                  understanding the truth of the statement.

Kaori-Chan 7/29/01  1:40 AM  You yourself couldn't wrap your brain around
                                  how a person can exist and yet not be bound by

                                  abstracts... I was thinking in terms of
                                  spiritual definition, of inner structure...
                                  you were talking about the world and I was

                                  figured out what you were really trying to

AV         7/29/01  1:55 AM  I've wasted a lot of time trying to become
                                  articulate enough to tease the intangible and
                                  invisible out of words... in my writing you
                                  can see my attempts to say what cannot be
                                  said, for it is beyond saying... it is beyone
                                  the definiton of words, and only barely within
                                  the realm of the mind to experience... what
                                  I've written is usually too much for people to
                                  digest... and... ultimately I am left with my
                                  first feeling, that there is no way to express
                                  my understanding save for to embody my
                                  understanding... to be that which I strive to
                                  express... I am that understanding of what
                                  cannot be said or shown or suggested... I
                                  exist simply for the reason that there is not
                                  other way to present my understanding
                                  
                                  I wanted to apply that understanding to my
                                  life... to be whole and self possessed... I
                                  knew that there was one thing I wanted that I
                                  could describe, that I could express... but I
                                  honestly did not want to face the real
                                  implications of my understanding

                                  cannot change the intrinsic truth of that
                                  statement... they both say the same thing, and
                                  what they say can hardly be tolerated by
                                  "educated" men

AV         7/29/01  2:03 AM  for the things I have dared to think, I can be
                                  called insane... but I am almost frighteningly
                                  sane...

Kaori-Chan 7/29/01  2:03 AM  you said you started seeing what I meant? or
                                  understanding what I meant?

AV         7/29/01  2:05 AM  I know that I am not the only person to ever
                                  see or think or understand what I have... I
                                  have always understood what you were talking
                                  about... I had to understand it to begin my
                                  "quest" when I lay down and thought about what
                                  you'd said, that's when I finally heard you
                                  clearly and understood what you were trying to
                                  say... what you were trying to encourage me to
                                  do

AV         7/29/01  2:06 AM  insert a break between "quest" and "when"

AV         7/29/01  2:10 AM  um... for a long time, I tried very hard to
                                  stress to people the necessity of making the
                                  leap from a concept to the literal, actual
                                  embodiment of a truth... with words it is
                                  possible to build up a very detailed picture
                                  of a tree in someone's mind, but one cannot
                                  truly understand a tree until one has actually
                                  walked right up to a tree, taken it in through
                                  all their senses, and then taken that final
                                  step to tuning into the tree itself, feeling
                                  it as a part of yourself... I take that very
                                  seriously, and so when I say I understand
                                  something I mean, I have gone to great pains
                                  to find out what that something really is, to
                                  transcend the conceptual understanding and
                                  embrace the actuality

AV         7/29/01  2:15 AM  when I try to "change" the world, I can move
                                  beyond myself and put my hands on things that
                                  defy explanation, and I can feel myself, a
                                  part of myself, holding me back... a
                                  deliberate and necessary restraint... what I
                                  often feel is a reprimand... that I am trying
                                  too hard, that I am daring to circumvent the
                                  proper channels to acheive my will... 
                                  
                                  it simply boggles my mind that... there is
                                  something more important than manifesting my
                                  true form... that... in very simple and
                                  straightforward terms... I can't quite bring
                                  myself to assume the godhead

AV         7/29/01  2:20 AM  we all need to take "responsibility" for our
                                  own existence, and a small percentage of us
                                  actually "want" to... but the hardest thing,
                                  the most frustrating thing is "accepting"
                                  responsibility for our selves hand in hand
                                  with the power and authority to bear that
                                  responsibility... I wish I could really
                                  explain it, but it's one of those things that
                                  is insanely complex and ridiculously simple

Kaori-Chan 7/29/01  2:21 AM  ::still listening::

AV         7/29/01  2:22 AM  the fact is, it is simply the truth of
                                  existence... it's not such a terribly
                                  difficult thing to understand, although a
                                  great deal of life is geared to lead us to
                                  that understanding

Kaori-Chan 7/29/01  2:23 AM  in other words, it is very hard to accept that
                                  you are god/goddess even though you strive
                                  towards such a unification of thought and
                                  spirit into a physical force?

AV         7/29/01  2:29 AM  yes... I am the embodiment of my
                                  understanding, the soul of my own truth... it
                                  can be no other way... 
                                  
                                  no one is responsible for your existence but
                                  you... you are your own creator, your own
                                  creation... 
                                  
                                  it's... well... the mind houses the work of
                                  the soul, it is in the mind that the world
                                  takes form... it's a profound shift in
                                  consciousness when you face the prospect of
                                  translating thought into reality deliberately

Kaori-Chan 7/29/01  2:31 AM  at current it is backwards, we take in reality
                                  and form it into thought.... the reverse could
                                  be just as true.
                                  
                                  If the future WILL exist, then it HAS existed
                                  and exists somewhere... therefore, we can
                                  access it NOW and know it BEFORE since it has
                                  always been...
                                  
                                  this is not dependant on time, in fact, any
                                  conceptualized system of time can pretty much
                                  destroy that mode of thought.

AV         7/29/01  2:32 AM  external reality, despite it's many threats
                                  and flaws, offers a kind of reassurance... a
                                  way to convince yourself that existence is
                                  more than a dream, or a delusion... however,
                                  the world is tip toeing closer to the
                                  realization that the mind is the foundation of
                                  reality, that reality evolves from dreams, and
                                  that the past is as mutable as the future, and
                                  the only true limits to our existence are the
                                  ones we impose on ourselves

Kaori-Chan 7/29/01  2:33 AM  yes.

AV         7/29/01  2:35 AM  the many private worlds of What Dreams May
                                  Come... that's True... for every mind is a
                                  world unto itself, and any mind can enter into
                                  such a dream and make it real, to join in and
                                  take part... life and death are artificial
                                  distinctions... there is no difference... the
                                  fact is, we are simply ignorant of the "rules"
                                  or the simple, universal truth... and thus
                                  somewhat helpless to resist the ideas which
                                  shape the world we are in

Kaori-Chan 7/29/01  2:36 AM  *nods*
                                  
                                  What does this mean to you, Alex?

AV         7/29/01  2:42 AM  what's true in our minds is true... the world
                                  is exactly what we believe it to be... it
                                  doesn't matter if the ideas are our own, or if
                                  we learn them as children and become
                                  conditioned to accept those assertions as
                                  true. Now, I have always understood that this
                                  world is sort of a school... nothing that
                                  happens here is evil, it is simply that this
                                  is a place in which we are left to our own
                                  devices... essentially, by nature, we only
                                  understand what we figure out for ourselves...
                                  what I was talking about before, about
                                  testing... it's not all that structured... we
                                  design the tests for ourselves, and really,
                                  they are just situations which offer
                                  opportunities to learn and grow... the sole
                                  purpose of life in this world is for
                                  individuals to "get it"... and, it follows
                                  that you don't really, truly "get it" until
                                  you find some way to "apply" it to your own
                                  life, your own existence

AV         7/29/01  2:43 AM  the truth is never hidden... it is always
                                  right there in your face... the trick to the
                                  truth is being able to accept it

AV         7/29/01  2:47 AM  accepting the truth is not a singluar act...
                                  it is not a thing done at one point in your
                                  existence... is is an endless act, it is
                                  enacted in every moment of existence... truth
                                  is an absolute, like God... it is limitless,
                                  indefinable, inescapible, omnipresent,
                                  omniscient and omnipotent... you cannot grasp
                                  the truth... you have to BE the truth... you
                                  have to grasp yourself to grasp it... you have
                                  to be self possessed...

AV         7/29/01  3:07 AM  alright, I'm back

Kaori-Chan 7/29/01  3:08 AM  I am trying to help you find the solution you
                                  need... I suppose.

AV         7/29/01  3:08 AM  I appreciate that, most sincerely

Kaori-Chan 7/29/01  3:09 AM  I must conferr that I am unsure if I am
                                  helping at all, or if you are just as
                                  stalemated as you were before we met.

AV         7/29/01  3:10 AM  just the fact that you care helps

AV         7/29/01  3:13 AM  I get the feeling that you spend a lot of time
                                  thinking about me, and that for the most part
                                  your thoughts are affectionate and supportive

Kaori-Chan 7/29/01  3:14 AM  i do spend a lot of time thinking of you... 
                                  =(  Do you think I am being selfish and
                                  impatient?
                                  
                                  I want this to happen and don't like waiting. 
                                  I feel shallow and selfish.

AV         7/29/01  3:22 AM  well, I suppose that depends on what sort of
                                  thoughts you're having... if you're thinking
                                  of me in a possessive or abusive way...
                                  thinking of me as some sort of object to seize
                                  and hold on to, like some sort of trophy...
                                  that might be a bit selfish... but that does
                                  not come through in your conversations with
                                  me... yes, you can be a bit self absorbed, but
                                  that is part of being an artist... I can
                                  understand your impatience and the frustration
                                  which comes from knowing what sort of
                                  situation I am in... these obstacles are
                                  annoying and painful... you are lonely, as am
                                  I... that desire to curl up together and cry
                                  stems from long years of trying to endure
                                  alone in a world where we are not allowed to
                                  be truly self sufficient... 

AV         7/29/01  3:27 AM  I have heard you talk about wanting what's
                                  best for me... I've heard you say how much it
                                  means to you just to have found me, even as I
                                  am... I know that I drive you insane at times,
                                  by going long stretches without talking to
                                  you, and believe me it hurts me to think how
                                  my inattentiveness makes you feel... I admit
                                  that at times I've been concerned that you
                                  might be too demanding for me... but I also
                                  know you can't help it... I am everything you
                                  have ever wanted... given that I ever manage
                                  to get all of me here!  

AV         7/29/01  3:30 AM  you want me... in the flesh... not what I can
                                  give you, not what I can do for you, not how I
                                  make you appear to others... you want me in
                                  your life, as a friend, a partner, a lover...
                                  you want a family with me... our children...
                                  our lives, together... and the thought that
                                  there is anything that could deny us that...
                                  it eats at you

AV         7/29/01  3:30 AM  I do understand... 

AV         7/29/01  3:31 AM  it scares me to think that you love me that
                                  much...

AV         7/29/01  3:32 AM  I've never been that important to ANYONE

AV         7/29/01  3:33 AM  sometimes I just can't deal with it... I just
                                  become too dazed to even think straight

AV         7/29/01  3:35 AM  the thought of disappointing you is torture,
                                  and I know... every time I look down... what a
                                  major disappointment I already am

AV         7/29/01  3:36 AM  ::cups your cheek with her hand::

AV         7/29/01  3:37 AM  you have made me feel the pain of my existence
                                  more keenly than anyone alive

AV         7/29/01  3:38 AM  it has always grieved me that I could not
                                  prove my own reality to the people I've known
                                  
                                  but, to fail to prove my reality to you is
                                  both an insult and an affront that cannot be
                                  tolerated... at times I hate myself for
                                  showing you my true face

AV         7/29/01  3:41 AM  I wish I had not put your heart at risk

Kaori-Chan 7/29/01  3:41 AM  Hang on.... reading all your messages.

Kaori-Chan 7/29/01  3:42 AM  Alex... I love you.  What more is there to
                                  say?

AV         7/29/01  3:45 AM  only that I love you

Kaori-Chan 7/29/01  3:46 AM  I just worry, validly, that my love is the
                                  kind of selfish love that would do neither of
                                  us any good... I don't believe it is, but how
                                  can I know?

AV         7/29/01  3:48 AM  would you take me just the way I am?

Kaori-Chan 7/29/01  3:49 AM  at times, i think i would, and at times I am
                                  weaker than I like.

AV         7/29/01  3:58 AM  ::chuckles:: there is no doubt is would be
                                  unbearable frustrating for both of us... I
                                  know I'd feel very awkward... and ugly... we
                                  could only be friends... I... intimacy would
                                  be very difficult to deal with... I'd always
                                  be willing to try, but I would be painfully
                                  aware how... horrible it would be for you... I
                                  doubt I could take any pleasure in a
                                  relationship involving the body I now
                                  inhabit...
                                  
                                  I would not ask you to take me as I am... *I*
                                  have problems with that, BIG problems... 
                                  
                                  I don't know how to answer your concern...
                                  from what I can see, you suffer from what ails
                                  most men... I think your worry simply stems
                                  from self consciousness... I've had my own
                                  brand of concerns, whether I'm any good for
                                  you... but... how can we know until we really
                                  can pursue a relationship...
                                  
                                  I think this conversation is an important step
                                  for both of us... I think we needed to have
                                  this conversation before I could truly
                                  overcome my own paralysis

AV         7/29/01  4:00 AM  even if we were totally wrong for each other,
                                  I'd still want to give it a go... ::grin::

Kaori-Chan 7/29/01  4:04 AM  *Nods* Alex, I don't feel we ARE wrong for
                                  eachother...  =(  I feel as if I can trust
                                  you.
                                  
                                  The times when I have been enraged and
                                  frustrated you have let me spout off
                                  everything I feel and patiently taken it in,
                                  listening, until I quelled the storm.

AV         7/29/01  4:05 AM  it was the least I could do

Kaori-Chan 7/29/01  4:07 AM  the only way to help me open is to suffer the
                                  storms... =( You did that once, how long can
                                  you stand such things? I haven't had another
                                  one since then.

AV         7/29/01  4:15 AM  you've put up with my worst habit... my
                                  "withdrawal" tactics... and you've listened to
                                  me bitch and moan about how much I hate being
                                  in my present condition... you listened to me
                                  talking from the very beginning about taking
                                  miracles into my own hands, and entertaining
                                  notions of divinity... you've given me the
                                  benefit of the doubt to an extraordinary
                                  degree
                                  
                                  to be honest, I am grateful for the fits and
                                  tempers you've thrown... I did not know if I
                                  *could* stand you at your worst, and now that
                                  I have seen you at your worst, I can honestly
                                  say I love you... I would not have put up with
                                  it otherwise... I might not like to see it
                                  again, and I might not always be able to deal
                                  with it... but I do know I have genuine
                                  feelings for you, not simply some infatuation,
                                  or romantic illusions... 

Kaori-Chan 7/29/01  4:17 AM  =(  I can be a lot worse, I can be.... mean.
                                  
                                  I think I have mentioned it.  I used to take
                                  my anger out on other people, particularly
                                  people close to me, when something unrelated
                                  might be bothering me.  Or, if the people I
                                  hung out with didn't agree with me, I would be
                                  incredibly cruel in my verbalizations.

AV         7/29/01  4:22 AM  verbal nastiness is something I can forgive...
                                  admittedly, it can hurt me sometimes even
                                  worse than physical abuse, but... I am not as
                                  likely to strike back for a tongue lashing as
                                  I might if you actually hit me... I have
                                  learned how to contain my emotions, but,
                                  physical/sensual triggers bypass my control,
                                  and all of my emotions are frighteningly
                                  powerful unchecked, my temper almost certainly
                                  the worst

Kaori-Chan 7/29/01  4:24 AM  *Nods* If we can handle eachother, we should
                                  be okay...
                                  
                                  And even though I downgrade myself in many
                                  things I say, I do it out of caution and
                                  concern for YOUR well being.  I want you to
                                  know what you're involved with.

AV         7/29/01  4:33 AM  um... I suppose I appreciate it, in a way...
                                  at least it is honest... I hope you don't mind
                                  if I prefer to encourage and nurture your
                                  finer qualities... if you can pardon me saying
                                  so, everyone's shit stinks... please don't
                                  make a point of rubbing my nose in it... I
                                  know you're not perfect... I am not asking you
                                  to be perfect for me... though I do hope you
                                  care for your own integrity
                                  
                                  I hope that my own efforts to warn you of
                                  my... less than ideal traits... has not
                                  slipped you by, or smacked you too rudely in
                                  the face... it's all give and take...
                                  cooperative effort... you can't ever hope to
                                  control me, I'm quite challenged in that
                                  department for my own part! Still, we should
                                  be able to live together amicably, I think

                                  ::Kisses back:: Go and get some rest, my
                                  beloved one.  My lady in red.

AV         7/29/01  4:50 AM  mmmm... ::curls up in your arms and closes her
                                  eyes:: I will... 
                                  love you...

Kaori-Chan 7/29/01  4:51 AM  And I love you so very... very much...

AV         7/29/01  4:51 AM  ::smiles:: ... wonderful... man... you... 

AV         7/30/01  2:11 AM  hey you... I was just on my way to bed when I
                                  noticed you were online...

Kaori-Chan 7/30/01  2:11 AM  aaaah.... Planet of the Apes is a trip.

AV         7/30/01  2:13 AM  yes... it certainly was... I saw it on friday
                                  night... I am still not sure if I really liked
                                  it

Kaori-Chan 7/30/01  2:14 AM  I definitely liked it.  ^>^  I look forward to
                                  the inevitable sequel...
                                  
                                  that and I think I was the only person who
                                  felt that Leo and Ari should have gotten
                                  together.  Several people thought it was gross
                                  that he kissed her.  ^^;

AV         7/30/01  2:15 AM  ::chuckles:: I was under the impression that
                                  there was supposed to be a love scene with the
                                  two of them... I was disappointed that they
                                  decided not to go there... but, given Leo's
                                  character, I was not terribly surprised he
                                  dissed her

Kaori-Chan 7/30/01  2:17 AM  Reading some stuff about the movie.... >=( 
                                  Moments like that are wasted on people who are
                                  shallow.... who think it's disgusting, a man
                                  kissing an ape.
                                  
                                  Some day, genetic engineering will introduce
                                  this very same situation... someone
                                  genetically crossed with an animal or some
                                  such, and it will be no different. 
                                  Discrimination will begin all over again.

AV         7/30/01  2:19 AM  I know... 
                                  
                                  well... I really can't talk... I need to go to
                                  bed...  I was on all evening and am now burned
                                  out
                                  
                                  take care, Love... goodnight

Kaori-Chan 7/30/01  2:20 AM  ::Nods:: I liked Ari.... goodnight I guess,
                                  love.  ::Kisses::

AV         7/30/01  2:21 AM  I liked her too... I don't mean to be rude and
                                  brush you off... I am just too tired to
                                  think... we can talk about the movie
                                  tomorrow... ::kisses you warmly::
                                  
                                  goodnight

Kaori-Chan 7/30/01  3:16 AM  when will you be on, Alex?

AV         8/1/01   12:27 AM I just got on

Kaori-Chan 8/1/01   12:28 AM heya.  *Kisses*

AV         8/1/01   12:28 AM hi there ::wraps her arms around you and
                                  returns your kisses::

Kaori-Chan 8/1/01   12:28 AM *Smiles* Hey there.
                                  
                                  You know you haven't been on IRC in ages.

AV         8/1/01   12:30 AM I know... maybe it's just mental fatigue, but
                                  it seems like I never even think about it

Kaori-Chan 8/1/01   12:30 AM you seem way busy lately...

AV         8/1/01   12:34 AM ::smiles:: yep, that's me, spinning my wheels
                                  and gettin' no where! I have been fooling
                                  around with photoshop trying to make what I
                                  can find of my old artwork web presentable...
                                  I've got some web space courtesy of Launce
                                  that I wanted to put some of my art and
                                  writing up on... it's keeping me busy, but at
                                  the moment I am far far away from having
                                  anything to put up

Kaori-Chan 8/1/01   12:35 AM kay.  *Nod nods and hugs*

Kaori-Chan 8/1/01   12:39 AM I'm on starchat if you want....
                                  #DragonPhoenix, been keeping it going for ya.

AV         8/1/01   12:40 AM the funny thing is, in principle it ought to
                                  be relatively simple to throw up a simple
                                  website, but I have been just dragging on it
                                  for a few days already!
                                  
                                  um... well, I can join you... thanks for
                                  keeping the channel alive for me!

AV         8/1/01   2:46 AM  and another goodnight to you!
                                  
                                  I'll leave this window open while I am using
                                  the bathroom
                                  

Kaori-Chan 8/1/01   2:46 AM  ::Smiles, kissing you:: This is... a little
                                  scary of a prospect, but if we can be together
                                  I will be happy.

AV         8/1/01   3:06 AM  ::grins wide and molests you with kisses of
                                  her own:: I know... it is a bit wild! If we
                                  can be together, then things will be perfect,
                                  and, it also puts us on even footing... if I
                                  can pull it off, it will be a dream come
                                  true... I'll try to give you time to think
                                  about it, and hopefully we can go over all the
                                  details
                                  
                                  thank you for considering this, for wanting to
                                  make me happy, and for willing to be a part of
                                  what I need to do... on all the things that
                                  really matter you're simply perfect! 
                                  
                                  I have to sign off and go to bed now, but as
                                  soon as I can, I'll talk to you tomorrow!

Kaori-Chan 8/1/01   3:07 AM  *Nod nods* I hope you get enough rest, Alex.

AV         8/1/01   3:07 AM  me too! goodnight love! mmmmmwwaaaaaahhh!

Kaori-Chan 8/1/01   3:07 AM  goodnight.  *Smiles*

AV         8/2/01   2:55 AM  I wanted to at least say hi before going to
                                  bed...

Kaori-Chan 8/2/01   2:55 AM  yeah... you kinda forgot you were gonna talk
                                  to me I guess? hehe.

AV         8/2/01   2:57 AM  well... a few hours working in the yard under
                                  the hot sun and I was pretty out of it... sat
                                  down to work on my web design and time just
                                  zipped by me... I apologise...
                                  
                                  I've been keeping what we talked about last
                                  night going in the back of my mind, and I have
                                  been thinking about you today...

Kaori-Chan 8/2/01   2:58 AM  okay.  *nods and smiles*

AV         8/2/01   2:59 AM  at the very least, keeping busy and doing
                                  creative type stuff has kept me on an even
                                  keel today... no chance to get depressed, and
                                  I've been taking on more and getting more
                                  accomplished... that's a nice change from a
                                  few days ago, when I couldn't manage much more
                                  than to get lost in a book

Kaori-Chan 8/2/01   3:00 AM  so what have you been thinking about?

AV         8/2/01   3:01 AM  it's sort of funny, but... one of the reasons
                                  I didn't think to talk to you earlier was
                                  because I sort of *felt* your presence around
                                  me today... I couldn't miss you, you were
                                  right there! ::giggles::

Kaori-Chan 8/2/01   3:03 AM  heheh, alright.  ^^;

AV         8/2/01   3:08 AM  ::smiles and pulls you close::
                                  
                                  I have had some interesting thoughts though...
                                  among them a notion inspired by some of the
                                  things that've come out in my writing and an
                                  idea that struck me after you started telling
                                  me about Allen and Rose...
                                  
                                  in my stories, the Dragon and the Phoenix were
                                  originally parts of the same soul, a soul
                                  which evolved on it's own by sort of pushing
                                  off in two directions... the Dragon was like a
                                  god and the Phoenix was like a goddess, equal
                                  and opposite, when they finally met... they
                                  fell in love and completed each other, in the
                                  process becoming twins, sharing everything
                                  they had been with each other... so in that
                                  sense, we'd be those twins, and Allen and
                                  Rose, though they were once *us*, are
                                  different enough from who we've become that
                                  they're like out real parents... I know it's
                                  not quite like that, but... we are
                                  frighteningly similar in so many ways... it's
                                  what you commented on first when you met me

Kaori-Chan 8/2/01   3:10 AM  *Nod nods* I recall.

AV         8/2/01   3:14 AM  well... the thought of us like that makes me
                                  very happy... it's... something I've both
                                  wanted and needed... something I've been
                                  looking for... for a couple of years at
                                  least... and, when you look at it as male and
                                  female, something I've wanted for half my life

Kaori-Chan 8/2/01   3:15 AM  It scares me a little.

AV         8/2/01   3:16 AM  in what way?

Kaori-Chan 8/2/01   3:16 AM  Friends, family, the gulf such a change would
                                  cause.

AV         8/2/01   3:17 AM  ah... yes... THAT I understand! You're not
                                  alone there... it's part of what kept me
                                  paralyzed for so many years...

Kaori-Chan 8/2/01   3:17 AM  and what of your paralysis?

AV         8/2/01   3:25 AM  well... I spent a great deal of time
                                  struggling with that part of it... the
                                  consequences of the changes I had to
                                  embrace... and after much soul searching, and
                                  particularily after pulling back from the edge
                                  of suicide, I resolved the problem
                                  
                                  my friends and family, I intend to tell...
                                  they may not believe me at first, but
                                  ultimately, they will realize that it *is*
                                  still me... this is something I need to do to
                                  survive... it's the only chance I have of
                                  "happiness" or even a "normal" life
                                  
                                  I've already lost my original family, and
                                  because my family moved so much, I've lost
                                  almost all the friends I've ever made... I
                                  know I can survive if ultimately I am
                                  seperated from everyone I know... it is
                                  frightening, but I know I can do it, I've
                                  survived worse...
                                  
                                  for you, it's not quite as imperitive to
                                  change... but... if this is what I have to do,
                                  and if we are soul mates... it might be the
                                  only way you can really stay with me... there
                                  are too many ways you and I could be seperated
                                  if we don't go through this together... I
                                  would think that, for the love of your life,
                                  and all eternity, you might have a very good
                                  reason to want this too... 
                                  
                                  I hope you don't think or feel that I am
                                  pushing you to do this... you are absolutely
                                  welcome to go through this with me, but I
                                  won't demand it of you... you are free to do
                                  what *you* need to do

AV         8/2/01   3:30 AM  did you get all of that?

Kaori-Chan 8/2/01   3:31 AM  it's such a hard decision to make, Alex...
                                  I've grown up in one place all my life,
                                  Alaska.  Went to the same schools with people
                                  I grew up with, have had friends for... years
                                  and years.  Real life friends whom I've shared
                                  time with, in school and in life.
                                  
                                  I know... logically, having a second childhood
                                  would mean I could make new friends and have
                                  completely new experiences,

Kaori-Chan 8/2/01   3:31 AM  but in some ways the world in which children
                                  are growing up into nowadays scares me a bit.
                                  
                                  I do love you, I care about you so very much,
                                  but... it's only been two months so far, and
                                  I- I've never been someone to rush headlong
                                  into decisions.  Just changing genders is one
                                  thing, I could deal with that, I would enjoy
                                  it and love it.
                                  
                                  Yet, 13 years younger... no matter how I slice
                                  it, people would treat me so much differently,

Kaori-Chan 8/2/01   3:31 AM  people would grow distant.

AV         8/2/01   3:39 AM  I know... I am aware that this is like asking
                                  you to give up everything for me... and I know
                                  that's scary... that's why I can't really ask
                                  you to do this if you don't want to... I am
                                  not surprised that you've been...
                                  intimidated...
                                  
                                  you initially said yes... I need to know how
                                  you feel about it now... you can have as much
                                  time to think about it as you want, but...
                                  if... well... I am aware that my "miracle"
                                  engine is sort of on auto pilot... I am always
                                  prepared for something impossible to happen
                                  without warning... if you don't want that to
                                  happen with this, you need to tell me... that
                                  is... do I have permission still to change
                                  you?

Kaori-Chan 8/2/01   3:41 AM  how am I supposed to answer?  On the one hand,
                                  there is the woman I've searched for all my
                                  life.... on the other, there is the life I've
                                  known in this existence.

AV         8/2/01   3:46 AM  hmmm... well, I am quite familiar with that
                                  kind of question... okay, for now I won't take
                                  any liberties... unless I can manage to make
                                  it possible for you to control it, make it so
                                  that you can shift back if you want to, I
                                  won't turn you into my twin... unless you tell
                                  me otherwise

Kaori-Chan 8/2/01   3:48 AM  but there is the other matter too, Alex... you
                                  are also asking me to... dare I say it, become
                                  a goddess with you.
                                  
                                  A goddess, a being of divinity, on earth! It
                                  is both invigorating an Idea and a frightening
                                  one.
                                  
                                  You have said as much that we would not be
                                  your... typical children, far beyond our
                                  years, and you with abilities beyond any
                                  normal child yet seen.

AV         8/2/01   3:48 AM  there is that... ::grin::

Kaori-Chan 8/2/01   3:49 AM  do you know what you WOULD be limited to? You
                                  said you had to think about that, or that you
                                  might not know until it happened.

AV         8/2/01   3:54 AM  oh, I have an idea of what sort of limits I'd
                                  have to start out with... it'd probably take
                                  me 10 years to reach my full potential... I'd
                                  start out with some "powers" like telepathy,
                                  telekinesis, regeneration... simple "psionic"
                                  abilities... and if necessary I might be able
                                  to invoke or evoke greater power through
                                  meditation or ritual... essentially "magic"
                                  spells... if you've ever read Oh My Goddess,
                                  you can understand the level of power I'd be
                                  able to work with
                                  
                                  Call me the Class 1, Catagory 1 Goddess of
                                  Sex, Unlimited, with Probationary Limiters

AV         8/2/01   3:54 AM  ::giggle::

Kaori-Chan 8/2/01   3:54 AM  very cute, however, me... I can't do much of
                                  anything in that field of stuff.

AV         8/2/01   3:56 AM  not now... maybe not... but... I think that
                                  with a bit of encouragement and help from me
                                  you can figure out what your true potential
                                  is... 

Kaori-Chan 8/2/01   3:57 AM  I am very tempted to OK the whole thing... do
                                  you think I am power hungry, Alex?

AV         8/2/01   4:00 AM  well... the real test of power is... you have
                                  to give it to yourself... it resides within
                                  you, and the gate keeper is a part of you...
                                  
                                  power is a necessity... we all need power, and
                                  we all desire to have power over our own
                                  lives... and, there are perfectly legitimate
                                  reasons to want and need power over others...
                                  but power brings with it obligations... it's
                                  the obligations that determine whether or not
                                  you'll have power... if you can't hack the
                                  obligations, you won't be able to access the
                                  power

Kaori-Chan 8/2/01   4:02 AM  are you supposed to do good with such power?
                                  Evil? Are there such things, or are they just
                                  conglomerations of human conceptualism?

AV         8/2/01   4:08 AM  good and evil are just matters of
                                  perspective... hence, the thing that is most
                                  important for a person to have is perspective,
                                  to understand the impact, and the consequences
                                  of one's own actions... you have to break away
                                  from the human notions of good and evil, order
                                  and chaos, right and wrong... the purpose of
                                  any reality is participation... power
                                  corresponds to the level of your
                                  participation... 
                                  
                                  the most unnatural thing about out lives in
                                  this world is that we have to surrender the
                                  power we naturally possess... we're not
                                  normally inclined to exist without power...
                                  but, we go through it in order to gain
                                  perspective

Kaori-Chan 8/2/01   4:09 AM  Alex, have you been able to change all this
                                  time and.... just have been having trouble
                                  trying to become 17?

AV         8/2/01   4:12 AM  it's possible... I have not *done* it, but I
                                  can't think of a single reason *why* except
                                  that I am... focusing on the wrong things... 
                                  
                                  I learned that it's okay to make mistakes, and
                                  that by making mistakes I learn more than I'd
                                  imagine I could... compromising my true
                                  desire, or my real needs could very well keep
                                  me paralyzed

Kaori-Chan 8/2/01   4:14 AM  This is what you want, both of us together,
                                  twin girls?

AV         8/2/01   4:15 AM  yes

Kaori-Chan 8/2/01   4:16 AM  yet you say we will... retain our selves, our
                                  memories, our experience.
                                  
                                  How does retaining them help in what you long
                                  to do? Live the life of a girl growing up?

AV         8/2/01   4:26 AM  my memories are an important part of who I
                                  am... the presence of my memories does not
                                  compromise my life as a girl growing up... as
                                  long as they do not prevent me from
                                  experiencing things... they can not interfere
                                  with my real objective, dealing with the world
                                  as my true self... I need to go back to
                                  childhood because it is in childhood that the
                                  experiences which prepare a person to be a
                                  woman happen... I can't just create those
                                  experiences... I have to life through them

Kaori-Chan 8/2/01   4:28 AM  how are we going to do this? Who is going to
                                  take care of two 7 year old girls? How are we
                                  going to MEET for that matter?

AV         8/2/01   4:33 AM  oops... the typo meter just informed me it's
                                  wwwaaaaaayyy past my bed time!
                                  
                                  um... I can answer those questions, but not
                                  quickly
                                  remember to ask me tomorrow
                                  honestly, if it can be done at all, *these*
                                  aren't very big problems
                                  for all I know, I can summon up Allen and Rose
                                  to take care of us...
                                  still, it's a lot easier for a couple of
                                  orphan kids to appear out of nowhere than a
                                  full grown adult... and kids are taken care
                                  of, we'd be placed in foster care or an
                                  orphanage, and put up for adoption... it's be
                                  like summer camp for a while, and then...
                                  things would come together
                                  as for us meeting... that's a matter of
                                  choice... there are lots of options depending
                                  on how well you can deal with the shock of
                                  experiencing the miracle of transformation

AV         8/2/01   4:34 AM  I've been thinking about this stuff all day

Kaori-Chan 8/2/01   4:34 AM  If you can work out those problems, I might be
                                  a tad less scared.

AV         8/2/01   4:35 AM  I intended to... don't worry, I've already
                                  done all the worring for this sort of thing a
                                  thousand times over... once you get used to
                                  the idea that a body can be transformed, and
                                  understand a little of how it can be
                                  transformed, you realize the literally
                                  anything is possible... you just need to know
                                  how to go about it

Kaori-Chan 8/2/01   4:36 AM  I suppose what I can say is... I trust you...
                                  I want to be with you... and I believe we
                                  should be together.
                                  
                                  Perhaps the two of us, together, can make some
                                  sort of difference in this world.

AV         8/2/01   4:37 AM  I hope so... and I totally agree

Kaori-Chan 8/2/01   4:37 AM  you are, as always, a leap of faith for me...
                                  one I don't regret.

AV         8/2/01   4:38 AM  ::smile:: and you are a wonderful enigma to
                                  me... I am very happy I listened to my
                                  instincts about you and pursued you

Kaori-Chan 8/2/01   4:39 AM  I am with you.... if you need me, Alex.

AV         8/2/01   4:40 AM  excellent!
                                  
                                  and for now, sweet sweet goodnight, love... 

Kaori-Chan 8/2/01   4:41 AM  goodnight, and sweet dreams Alex.

AV         8/2/01   4:41 AM  ::kisses you, and holds you tight... fading
                                  gently into slumber in your arms::

Kaori-Chan 8/2/01   4:42 AM  ::Sighs, drifting off with you.::

AV         8/2/01   4:42 AM  ^_^

AV         8/6/01   2:01 AM  ::sits down beside you and slips her hand into
                                  yours::

Kaori-Chan 8/6/01   2:04 AM  hey.  Where you been?

AV         8/6/01   2:07 AM  hey... I've been a bit... out of sorts. That's
                                  hardly new I guess. Getting up and doing yard
                                  work, starting on the computer in the evening
                                  when I get done, remembering I'm gonna be
                                  rousted out of bed early again the next day...
                                  it's like, I don't really have time to think,
                                  or I'm too tired to keep my mind from slipping
                                  into dispair... I don't realize how much time
                                  slips by until too much time already has

Kaori-Chan 8/6/01   2:10 AM  I can't be online every night at 2am.

AV         8/6/01   2:18 AM  honestly, it's not a good idea for me
                                  either... I seem to think to check my icq only
                                  when I'm getting ready to shut down my
                                  computer and go to bed... maybe it's only as I
                                  am calling it quits for the day that I can
                                  calm my mind and relax, and then you're like
                                  the first thing I think of... but when I'm
                                  stressed I don't seem to think about anything
                                  but what's most immediate and pressing
                                  
                                  not good for either of us, and forgive me if
                                  it sounds like I'm making an excuse...
                                  typically, I don't care what anyone thinks
                                  enough to make excuses, but I do try to figure
                                  out for myself *why* I do the things I do and
                                  am not at all shy about sharing my wild assed
                                  guesses
                                  
                                  I suppose I don't care what people think
                                  because in that area my motivation has been
                                  more based on fear than concern... I worry
                                  about what people are thinking, but only in
                                  the sense of gathering "intelligence" on a
                                  potential threat! I am one sick kitten,
                                  Mark... 

Kaori-Chan 8/6/01   2:20 AM  urrr... you don't sound all that strange, from
                                  my point of view.

AV         8/6/01   2:25 AM  ::smiles:: well, thanks...  I think ::blink,
                                  blink::
                                  
                                  this is what I get... speaking of my modus
                                  operandi... for spending the better part of my
                                  life trying to keep people from figuring out
                                  my true feelings... I've gotten so good at not
                                  showing or expressing my feelings that  it
                                  negatively effects my relationship with you...
                                  it's gotten to the point where, well, the
                                  first thing you say to me is "where the hell
                                  have you been?"
                                  
                                  I owe you better than that, but I confess that
                                  I don't know if I can *do* better than that
                                  under my present circumstances... for that I
                                  am sorry

Kaori-Chan 8/6/01   2:26 AM  no need to apologize, Alex.

AV         8/6/01   2:30 AM  ::hugs you tight:: thank you...
                                  
                                  well, in other news, Launce is trying to
                                  download a pirated copy of Final Fantasy for
                                  me, I'll be able to watch it til my eyes
                                  bleed! lol! 
                                  
                                  I really am being kicked out of bed early
                                  tomorrow, so... I'm gonna have to say
                                  goodnight

Kaori-Chan 8/6/01   2:31 AM  uhhuh.... *sighs*

AV         8/6/01   2:37 AM  ain't it a bitch? sometimes, life really does
                                  suck... I don't know what to say... I want to
                                  say I'll make a point of getting on earlier so
                                  we can spend more time talking... if Launce
                                  wasn't as much of a night owl as me, I would
                                  probably have continued gettin on at 10 and
                                  having many hours a night to talk with you...
                                  one of the drawbacks of being a guest in a
                                  person's house... you feel like going into
                                  your room to hang on your computer is both
                                  rude and antisocial... and I *have* to be nice
                                  to him... he's put a roof over my head and
                                  food in my mouth for over a month now... I
                                  know I'm too fucked up to take care of myself
                                  with my mind tied up on something literally
                                  out of this world
                                  ::shakes her head::
                                  O, to be in a better place in my life!

Kaori-Chan 8/6/01   2:38 AM  *Sighs*

AV         8/6/01   2:40 AM  ::cups your cheek with her hand:: I really
                                  need to find a more *entertaining* way to make

                                  things off my chest, but... you're not my
                                  emotional dumping ground
                                  
                                  I can spare a few minutes if there's anything
                                  you want or need to get off your chest too
                                  ::tilts her head and smiles at you::

Kaori-Chan 8/6/01   2:41 AM  We never talk, it seems... I will be patient
                                  for you, I know and realize you have a lot
                                  going on.

AV         8/6/01   2:44 AM  I know... I really do appreciate your
                                  patience... I know that's not the easiest
                                  thing for you to do, and I really really
                                  appreciate your understanding

Kaori-Chan 8/6/01   2:45 AM  I hope your getting kicked out of bed, working
                                  on your webpage, amongst other things isn't
                                  hampering what you want in your life.

AV         8/6/01   2:51 AM  I honestly don't think it makes any
                                  difference... I put up with a lot of things
                                  that demand my time, energy and attention what
                                  do not offer one ounce of help to me in
                                  realizing my dream... but when I manage to get
                                  everything in my life sorted out and have
                                  literally nothing to do, no distractions what
                                  so ever, just coping with the state I am in
                                  becomes overwhelming... these other activities
                                  do not overtly contribute to my success, but
                                  they distract me from the pain I am in and
                                  that helps me stay a little more sane... at a
                                  moment like this, right here, right now, I can
                                  suddenly see that there is something yet for
                                  me to learn, and... I am learning it... can't
                                  quite put it into words, but... I *feel* it,
                                  like brushing through spider webs in the dark

Kaori-Chan 8/6/01   2:52 AM  *Sighs*
                                  
                                  I sometimes ponder if this will go on forever,
                                  you learning lessons, but never gaining the
                                  ability.

AV         8/6/01   3:03 AM  ::nods:: don't think that dark thought never
                                  crosses my mind either... it can drive me mad

                                  tell me to just give it up, stop trying to
                                  "change the world" and learn to just live in

                                  that even the most minute concession that
                                  would be necessary for me to "settle for the
                                  least" would still be a miraculous
                                  transformation from male to female
                                  embodiment... I don't thing I could *ever* be
                                  at peace with my existence as a male... it's
                                  just torture
                                  
                                  this *can't* go on forever... if I can't find
                                  the means within myself to unleash the
                                  ability, then someone with the ability will
                                  have to take mercy on me and help me through
                                  it... otherwise, I won't last

Kaori-Chan 8/6/01   3:07 AM  *Sighs sadly* Alex......

AV         8/6/01   3:08 AM  it's called "thinking outside the box"

Kaori-Chan 8/6/01   3:09 AM  and what if you never do it?  What then?  What
                                  are your plans in case that happens?

AV         8/6/01   3:13 AM  imagine living your entire life locked in a
                                  basement... you're only contact with the world
                                  outside being a computer... you can glean
                                  something of the world on the net, even meet
                                  people and all that... but, you don't know
                                  where you really are, you can't really get
                                  outside help, and if the plants in the room
                                  with you should die, your air will run out and
                                  you will die... you might make the best of
                                  your situation, never ceasing in your efforts
                                  to escape your prison and ensure your
                                  survival, but never knowing if you will ever
                                  figure a way out of the trap... what plans
                                  *can* you make?

AV         8/6/01   3:16 AM  when you have nothing left to lose you don't
                                  make contingency plans for the event of
                                  failure... in a case like this, failure means
                                  death

Kaori-Chan 8/6/01   3:17 AM  alright, then what about me?

AV         8/6/01   3:32 AM  what about you? I don't mean to sound, well,
                                  *mean* but... you're not content with the idea
                                  that you might never see or touch me... but
                                  you're apparently willing to believe that
                                  there's nothing *you* can do about it...
                                  that's a position I can't afford to take, but
                                  I can't do anything to change how you feel or
                                  think about it...
                                  
                                  I worry because I realize that you more or
                                  less accept that you are powerless in this
                                  situation... you are not prepared for this,
                                  and in that sense it was wrong of me to drag
                                  you into it... as someone I love, and as
                                  someone who loves me, you have every right to
                                  be involved in this, but... you are at such a
                                  disadvantage, and... at this point I see no
                                  way for you to protect your own interests...
                                  even if you back out of the relationship you
                                  are going to get hurt... 
                                  
                                  it's a terrible thing to realize that your
                                  happiness is not in your own hands to
                                  attain... a terrible thing, because it's not
                                  really true... neither of us are powerless,
                                  but both of us are under certain restraints...
                                  I've done everything I can to understand the
                                  nature of my inhibitions and what I have to do
                                  to overcome them... ::sighs:: if you cannot
                                  afford to take the risk of holding on for
                                  however long this takes, if each day adds an
                                  unbearable weight... I will understand if you
                                  feel that is impossible for you to bear... I
                                  love you, Mark... if the best I can offer you
                                  forthe forseeable future is the freedom to
                                  leave me and go your own way... then I will
                                  let you go, in the hopes that you truly can be
                                  happier without me than with me... but I won't
                                  push you away

Kaori-Chan 8/6/01   3:34 AM  I just don't know, Alex, what I'm going to
                                  do... *Sighs*  How long do I wait? A year?
                                  Two?  Five?

AV         8/6/01   3:50 AM  I can't stand to wait another day... and I've
                                  felt that way for a few years now... I can't
                                  even think of waiting a week... thoughts of
                                  waiting for a week make me panic, and thinking
                                  a year in advance can.... well, I try not to
                                  think of it, it's very disturbing to find a
                                  knife in your hand and your mind lost in
                                  thought trying to decide how long this cut or
                                  that will take you to bleed to death from... 
                                  
                                  I can't wait... but, time goes on... I know a
                                  great deal of time might pass, but I can't
                                  simply wait... I do as much as I can, in every
                                  moment, to succeed now... I will not wait,
                                  Mark... I will pound away at this until I
                                  break through or simply break... I wasn't
                                  given anything better than that to go on... I
                                  made a promise to myself, and... I am entirely
                                  on my own here... I would appreciate some
                                  help, but, I don't expect any... I have
                                  nothing to lose, Mark... as far as I am
                                  concerned, my life hasn't even started yet... 
                                  
                                  if you really don't want to lose me, if you
                                  can't stand to walk away to save yourself from
                                  potential disappointment... the only thing I
                                  can suggest for you to do is... start working
                                  on your self... free your mind... figure out
                                  how to help me
                                  
                                  not for my benefit, but for your own... don't
                                  sit around feeling powerless, challenge that
                                  assumption, challenge the conditioning, fight
                                  for what you truly believe in, deep in your
                                  heart... there is a time to wait, and that's
                                  when you have things cooking in the oven,
                                  compiling in that computer you've got between
                                  your ears... you only wait when you've
                                  delegated every necessary resource to work
                                  that is best done without your immediate imput
                                  or involvement... 

Kaori-Chan 8/6/01   3:52 AM  what do you think I've tried to do from the
                                  beginning? Help you work through this!  I feel
                                  like everything I've done has been wasted, and
                                  effort was meaningless.  It is like attacking
                                  a brick wall with my bare fists.

AV         8/6/01   4:04 AM  oh Mark... you have given me a lot of help,
                                  help you have no idea you've even given me
                                  sometimes... it's not your fault I've been
                                  working on this for so long that I've already
                                  considered, tried, tested and applied just
                                  about every conceivable notion... I've already
                                  taken down a few miles of that brick wall with
                                  my bloody knuckles! 
                                  
                                  the problem is, the one thing I need is what
                                  you *can't* give me... the power I am trying
                                  to unleash is within me, and I can only get it
                                  from myself... until I do, I really am
                                  powerless, just like you... 
                                  
                                  you can't tell me how to give myself what you
                                  can't even imagine giving yourself... if you
                                  managed to tap into and realize your own
                                  power, you might be able to help... and the
                                  only reason I suggested it is... it's your
                                  powerlessness in this situation that's really
                                  eating you up... if you want to do something
                                  about *that* then I don't see any reason for
                                  you not to seek the power within yourself,
                                  then you might be able to do something more
                                  than wait for me to overcome my own
                                  paralysis... 

Kaori-Chan 8/6/01   4:05 AM  Alex, you're ten years ahead of me, and you've
                                  been working on this since age 7.... I think I
                                  am a little too far behind to help in any
                                  significant manner, not to mention too young
                                  to have learned all the things you have
                                  learned.

AV         8/6/01   4:13 AM  in the pursuit of self possession it is
                                  quality, not quantity, that matters... did you
                                  ever think that most of the time I've spent on
                                  this has been time wasted arguing with myself
                                  about great my ignorance and inexperience were
                                  and how improbable it would be for me to
                                  discover anything that would have any
                                  significant chance of fixing the problem? 
                                  
                                  there is no point worrying about how you do
                                  it, the only thing that matters is realizing
                                  that it has to be done and you have to do
                                  it... all I did, over all that time, was make
                                  it more complicated that it needs to be... if
                                  you want to make all the same mistakes I did,
                                  then you might need 23 years to accomplish
                                  it... if you want to become self possessed...
                                  you'd be surprised how quickly you can step up
                                  to the plate...

Kaori-Chan 8/6/01   4:15 AM  then let me tell you something....
                                  
                                  And I want you to listen caaarefully.
                                  
                                  The most self posessed I've ever been in my
                                  life is, a couple weeks back... when I was
                                  obsessing over Memes.  I was having a
                                  discussion with my best friend when something
                                  popped into my head and I began questioning
                                  every system of thought every made, and
                                  finding them to be prisons of the spirit.

Kaori-Chan 8/6/01   4:20 AM  that's it, Alex.  That's all I wanted you to
                                  consider...
                                  
                                  if there is an answer, it lies in the freeing
                                  of the human mind, which has a history of
                                  thousands of years in supplication to ideals,
                                  systems, and orders of thought.
                                  
                                  The most rational of people look upon such a
                                  destruction as oblivion, but how are you to
                                  know? Perhaps that is simply an extremely
                                  strong MEME placed there by someone who wanted
                                  to keep humanity in the darkness...
                                  
                                  Perhaps staring into the face of destruction,
                                  of utter and total annihilation is where you

                                  No, I am positive it is.

AV         8/6/01   4:24 AM  ::smiles:: I've been there...
                                  
                                  I've done that... in more ways that one... and
                                  the insane confidence I have in myself, and my
                                  inevitable acheivement, is a product of having
                                  faced not merely death, but anihilation... 

Kaori-Chan 8/6/01   4:26 AM  think about the closest man can come to
                                  oblivion, in his dreams, in his nightmares....
                                  which when one realizes are nightmares or
                                  dreams, control is gained, and you may stear
                                  those strange realities in any direction you
                                  wish.
                                  
                                  To clear ones mind of any system, to surpass
                                  the limits imposed upon us by thoughts is to
                                  gain control of reality itself.
                                  
                                  The impression of annihilation? Illusion. 
                                  Oblivion? A mere hologram in the eye of the
                                  mind, put there to deterr anyone from stepping
                                  into the threshhold which heralds the throne
                                  of man.

                                  now, and I must go to sleep... really, all I
                                  was saying is that I don't believe you need to
                                  resign yourself to just standing on the
                                  sidelines and waiting for me to pull off a
                                  miracle... you're just as capible of miracles
                                  as I... I won't ever quit, but... you could
                                  surprise us both by beating me to the punch

AV         8/6/01   10:08 PM yep! told ya I'd try... ::smiles::

Kaori-Chan 8/6/01   10:10 PM Lady Kiara has been asking about you, I told
                                  her you've only been on at 2am lately and she
                                  was a bit upset.  ^>^

AV         8/6/01   10:11 PM really? that's too bad, I'd love to talk to
                                  her... so, what have the two of you found to
                                  talk about?

Kaori-Chan 8/6/01   10:12 PM bits and pieces of things, we get along great,
                                  unlike Launce and I.  ^^;

                                  feeling today?

Kaori-Chan 8/6/01   10:15 PM really sorta horny.  ^^;;;
                                  
                                  I'm talking with Alyson, someone I've known
                                  for a couple years.
                                  
                                  She has this desire to be controlled that is
                                  sort of.. well, arousing.

Kaori-Chan 8/6/01   10:17 PM I wanna RP with you, it's been a long while.

AV         8/6/01   10:17 PM ::blink, blink::

                                  do you have anything in mind?

Kaori-Chan 8/6/01   10:18 PM I was wanting to continue that nabiki one,
                                  it's been long long time.

Kaori-Chan 8/6/01   10:18 PM or we could do a new one... =)

AV         8/6/01   10:20 PM um... maybe too long, I don't know how well I
                                  remember all of it... if we started a new one,
                                  did you have anything in mind? I have a few
                                  ticklings in the back of my brain, but I need
                                  a few minutes to tease any sense out of them!

Kaori-Chan 8/6/01   10:21 PM well... mm.... I kinda like Sluttification, if
                                  you know what that is?

AV         8/6/01   10:23 PM er... gimme a run down... depending on how you
                                  explain it, I'll either love it or hate it
                                  ::shrugs::

Kaori-Chan 8/6/01   10:25 PM it's what it sounds like, normal, innocent
                                  woman/girl with normal life starts becoming a
                                  slut/whore.

Kaori-Chan 8/6/01   10:33 PM Hellooo?

AV         8/6/01   10:34 PM the use of words like "slut" and "whore" in
                                  such a context suggest deliberate debasement,
                                  degredation, defilement... in so many words
                                  the demise of a woman's worth and integrity...
                                  maybe such labels *are* commonly applied to a
                                  girl who expresses a healthy interest in sex,
                                  and "sleeps around" but... I don't believe
                                  there's anything wrong with a girl who is
                                  sexually active. It's that "starts becoming a
                                  slut/whore" part that I need to have explained
                                  a bit better. If it is an essential and
                                  inescapible part of "sluttification" that the
                                  girl lose her honor and self respect... well,
                                  I don't know if I can *play* that kind of
                                  role. I'm not saying I won't try it, but... I
                                  really don't need to spend time right now
                                  disgracing myself

Kaori-Chan 8/6/01   10:36 PM you saw what I was doing to Ranma in the RP,
                                  right?  Or, What Kaoru was doing?
                                  
                                  

AV         8/6/01   10:37 PM yes... 

Kaori-Chan 8/6/01   10:38 PM most of it's similar to that...
                                  
                                  You're the best person I've RPed with by far,
                                  but if you can't roleplay degrandizement,
                                  *Shrugs* That permeates a lot of my
                                  roleplaying.
                                  
                                  Humiliation, fear, forced changes that the
                                  characters do not desire.

AV         8/6/01   10:46 PM ah... well... that's where I *live*
                                  
                                  it hardly strikes me as a great form of
                                  entertainment... I don't object to the themes,
                                  there are a lot of interesting things that can
                                  come out in an RP like that. The thing is,
                                  these are things that provoke the most violent
                                  and dangerous aspects of my psyche... you
                                  could say that these are what I regard as
                                  capital offenses, punishible by death... and
                                  when there is no way to target and take out
                                  the offending party, if the situation is
                                  utterly inescapible or the assailant is
                                  utterly beyond my power to retaliate
                                  against... well, I go *boom* I had a favorite
                                  character in a real time RP that the GM fucked
                                  over and, once she discovered that even her
                                  own powers to restore herself had been robbed,
                                  she killed herself on the spot... I am telling
                                  you this for your information, not to
                                  discourage you

Kaori-Chan 8/6/01   10:49 PM I have a defined line between what I roleplay
                                  and How I treat people in real life...  given
                                  the rare exception, of course.
                                  
                                  Roleplaying hentai, for me, is the ability to
                                  roleplay anything and everything that society
                                  frowns upon with no consequences.
                                  
                                  I typically roleplay such degrading and
                                  humiliating things with people I'm familiar
                                  with, people I know and trust, and all are
                                  willing and open to the RP, so it isn' as if
                                  the actual acts are

Kaori-Chan 8/6/01   10:49 PM Taking place.

AV         8/6/01   10:51 PM I understand

Kaori-Chan 8/6/01   10:51 PM how does this make you feel?

AV         8/6/01   10:56 PM ::tosses her head, shifting her hair over her
                                  shoulders::
                                  
                                  I don't really *feel* anything about it... for
                                  me it's a matter of handling... an adventure
                                  in this vein can be stimulating, even
                                  enjoyable, if it's handled in the right way
                                  and the scenes are done well... but it is also
                                  possible for such an adventure to become...
                                  disgusting to participate in

Kaori-Chan 8/6/01   10:59 PM generally, there's a point where I become
                                  bored since it goes into a blande
                                  repetitiveness.

AV         8/6/01   11:01 PM that doesn't sound like fun

Kaori-Chan 8/6/01   11:01 PM I mean, I end up stopping the RP when that
                                  happens.  

AV         8/6/01   11:07 PM okay, this is my take on it... I don't believe
                                  in simply indulging a fantasy when role
                                  playing... I am open to a whole realm of
                                  possible ordeals and hardships, I don't mind
                                  participating in a game in which my character
                                  has to endure absolutenly horrid abuses, but
                                  there has to be some point of the story, some
                                  underlying plot which can carry the character
                                  through whatever hell she must traverse to
                                  reclaim her dignity or simply to attain some
                                  necessary goal... there has to be a point in
                                  such an adventure where the character can
                                  start to fight back to her feet and find her
                                  way back to a safe or sane life... that
                                  requires a bit more of the person running the
                                  game, because they do have to make an effort
                                  to make a viable story out of things, but it
                                  is also my responsibility as a character to
                                  perservere and overcome whatever obstacles
                                  stand in my way... not so much so I can take
                                  revenge on whoever fucked with me, though that
                                  kind of desire is understandable, but so that
                                  I can sustain both the character and my
                                  interest in the story

AV         8/6/01   11:09 PM the reason I am a good role player is because
                                  I really do take seriously the notion that I
                                  am participating in the creation of a story,
                                  and that the story should have it's own
                                  validity

AV         8/6/01   11:10 PM I hope that doesn't sound like I'm too
                                  demanding to just RP hentai with...

AV         8/6/01   11:11 PM the thing I've always hated about hentai and
                                  american X rated movies is that they have no
                                  real value as stories... they are simply
                                  events... 

AV         8/6/01   11:11 PM do you understand what I mean?

Kaori-Chan 8/6/01   11:11 PM uhm, and I hope this doesn't sound too crude
                                  or gross...
                                  
                                  but the point of hentai roleplaying is for
                                  people to get off, so to speak.
                                  
                                  I usually don't resolve... actually, I've
                                  never resolved any hentai stories where the
                                  character gets back to normal.

AV         8/6/01   11:12 PM I suppose it's a matter of understanding how I
                                  get off, then

Kaori-Chan 8/6/01   11:12 PM you miss the entire point if you want hentai
                                  to be like normal roleplaying, they are two
                                  very seperate things.
                                  
                                  Much like the film industry and porn.

Kaori-Chan 8/6/01   11:13 PM For porn, the POINT of the entire story (If
                                  there even is one) is just to arouse the
                                  viewers.
                                  
                                  For the Film industry, good movie making makes
                                  the audience think or enjoy a plot that has a
                                  resolution.
                                  
                                  The entire purposes are two completely
                                  seperate beasts, Alex.
                                  
                                  Same goes for RP and HRP

AV         8/6/01   11:14 PM well... who's supposed to be getting off here?

AV         8/6/01   11:15 PM I desire more than physical arousal, I want to
                                  be mentally aroused, emotionally aroused, I
                                  want to be creatively aroused, I want to be
                                  stimulated as a whole person, not just a body
                                  part

Kaori-Chan 8/6/01   11:15 PM You know, this will sound completely selfish,
                                  but me.  I roleplay mostly for me.
                                  
                                  And, if you ask roland, I get rather pissy
                                  when I don't get my way in a HRP.
                                  
                                  Often times I might be generous and indulge
                                  others their pleasures, but 90% of the time
                                  HRP is for me, I invite people to play with
                                  ME, I don't invite myself to play with other
                                  people.... that is normal RP.

AV         8/6/01   11:16 PM ah... well... ::think, think::

Kaori-Chan 8/6/01   11:16 PM and while I would so very much love to play in
                                  a regular RP again, I can't.

AV         8/6/01   11:16 PM ::blink, blink:: why not?

Kaori-Chan 8/6/01   11:17 PM Too much time playing hentai, too many bad
                                  experiences with people I did role play with,
                                  and last of all, too many people know who I am
                                  and will prevent me from making enough IRC
                                  fans to form any sort of RP....
                                  
                                  and I am not allowed to RP in any anime
                                  channels, because everyone knows me and hates
                                  me because I question their authority over me.

AV         8/6/01   11:19 PM obviously there's a lot of history there I
                                  don't know...

AV         8/6/01   11:23 PM so, tell me if I understand this right... you
                                  like to play games in which you have absolute
                                  power over someone else, but you can't stand
                                  to let anyone have any real power over you?

Kaori-Chan 8/6/01   11:27 PM no, but such situations are rare for me.

Kaori-Chan 8/6/01   11:27 PM for instance, for about two or three weeks
                                  while you were offline, Roland and I played
                                  one where he had the master PC program and I
                                  played all the victims.
                                  
                                  He controlled the story.

AV         8/6/01   11:28 PM and... did you enjoy that?

Kaori-Chan 8/6/01   11:28 PM however, that's the exception, not the
                                  rule.... yes, I do like having power over
                                  others.  I do not like being subjected to
                                  other people's power because over a long time
                                  I've learned I don't like how others USE their
                                  power.

Kaori-Chan 8/6/01   11:29 PM Yes, I enjoyed it a great deal, however, it
                                  was just as pointless an RP as my own.  There
                                  was no resolution, nobodies lives got fixed in
                                  the end, nobody really got definitive revenge
                                  on anybody.  He had absolute power, and it
                                  wasn't a story with a resolution.

Kaori-Chan 8/6/01   11:30 PM I've only been able to roleplay, consistently,
                                  with a few poeple.  Roland, Jiyuna, and a
                                  couple others... Roland more recently has been
                                  the only one I've roleplayed with
                                  consistently.
                                  
                                  Roland doesn't like the seriousness of normal
                                  RP in his Hentai games... he told me this when
                                  you had lengthy expositions of Nabiki.  I
                                  enjoyed it because I felt it added depth to
                                  the characters plight.
                                  

AV         8/6/01   11:32 PM and... you don't think other people have that
                                  reaction to you, when you have that power?
                                  
                                  as for all of these stories just... falling
                                  off... I can't believe it's so hard to keep an
                                  extra dimension in play that allows things to
                                  level out between erotic episodes...

AV         8/6/01   11:33 PM I guess I am sort of an elitist when it comes
                                  to role playing...

Kaori-Chan 8/6/01   11:33 PM In the matter of Hentai, I don't really care
                                  about resolution.
                                  
                                  Anywhere else it matters to me.

Kaori-Chan 8/6/01   11:35 PM You find 7 other people to play, and perhaps
                                  then I'll resolve some hentai issues, until
                                  you find 7 people in this world that has the
                                  same tastes and flavors as I do, you're out of
                                  luck resolution wise in the hentai department.

AV         8/6/01   11:38 PM well... maybe we're standing on totally
                                  different points... I don't really much care
                                  for hentai or porno in the classic sense... I
                                  don't feel like explicit sexuality and
                                  eroticism, or even fetishism, is out of place
                                  in a normal RP... as for the pattern of your
                                  hentai games, leaving things unresolved irks
                                  me... actions have consequences and facing
                                  those consequences is a big part of what makes
                                  the scenes themselves worth playing out
                                  
                                  No. I won't go out recruiting like that...
                                  this is between you and I, and... at the
                                  moment I am still hesitant to play the sort of
                                  game you want... brb

AV         8/6/01   11:43 PM okay, I'm back ::smiles::

Kaori-Chan 8/6/01   11:45 PM Look, the problem with Resolving hentai is I
                                  become bored with something and want to try
                                  something new.  Hentai, to ME, is about
                                  roleplaying ideas I have.
                                  
                                  It's purely selfish, in a way.
                                  
                                  I'd love you to roleplay with me, but you
                                  know, I can't force you to do anything you
                                  don't want to do.
                                  
                                  

AV         8/6/01   11:52 PM well, look at it this way, if you allow the
                                  other person, the player, the ability to
                                  recover from something you've done to them,
                                  they can revert to a "normal" mode you can try
                                  new things on... but more than that, even a
                                  hentai game requires a tremendous investment
                                  in character development as well as
                                  significant effort in writing... with me
                                  that's particularily true... and over time you
                                  can have a very rich universe to draw from for
                                  future adventures... and, things don't have to
                                  be fully resolved. I mean, look at Ranma...
                                  he's been fucked with in spades and things are
                                  not ever fully resolved, but there is enough
                                  flexibility in the situation that he can adapt
                                  to things and cope... when new shit happens to
                                  him, he has more experience to draw from, but
                                  he always has to learn new tricks to cope...
                                  that's what I love about the series, and
                                  that's the kind of thing I want to try to
                                  create for myself... RP, hentai or otherwise,
                                  is a play ground... if you allow the other
                                  person a bit of breathing room the whole
                                  endeavor can benefit

Kaori-Chan 8/6/01   11:57 PM I just told you, I would be more than willing
                                  to do that with people with similar interests.
                                   I know a few, but it's incredibly difficult
                                  to get them all on at the same time.
                                  
                                  To have a developing HRP, you have to have
                                  regular cast beyond three people.

AV         8/6/01   11:58 PM hmmm...

Kaori-Chan 8/7/01   12:00 AM We can continue the Ranma one if you want, I
                                  was enjoying that. It was both roleplaying and
                                  hentai.
                                  
                                  However, we need more players.  I'm not going
                                  to do the entire cast by myself, and there
                                  aren't a lot of people who would stand for  a
                                  lot of my likes and such.

AV         8/7/01   12:04 AM actually, I was going to ask you... have you
                                  read Warren Smith's adaptations of the Dirty
                                  Pair?

Kaori-Chan 8/7/01   12:04 AM nope.

Kaori-Chan 8/7/01   12:05 AM I know ranma, tenchi(Some), Key: The Metal
                                  Idol(Some), Kenshin(Some), Golden Boy(All),
                                  Card Captor Sakura(Some), Nadesico(First
                                  tape), NGE(3 tapes), not much more than that.
                                  
                                  

AV         8/7/01   12:06 AM awwww... they are a lot of fun! I wouldn't
                                  mind playing Kei in an HRP... then again,
                                  Kei's like an avatar of myself the way Warren
                                  Smith does her! Lol!

Kaori-Chan 8/7/01   12:06 AM One tape.  The first one.

AV         8/7/01   12:06 AM hmmm... 

Kaori-Chan 8/7/01   12:07 AM I prefer Ranma, mostly.
                                  
                                  It's what I know.

AV         8/7/01   12:07 AM well... I'd love to do a Ranma *as* Ranma...

Kaori-Chan 8/7/01   12:08 AM Roland does Ranma.  *Shrugs* 

Kaori-Chan 8/7/01   12:08 AM see, that's also the problem with people...
                                  
                                  they all want to be Ranma if there's an RPG.
                                  
                                  so then we have NO other cast members.

AV         8/7/01   12:13 AM Nabiki's an interesting lil thing, but she's
                                  not really my style... in the Ranma universe,
                                  Ranma's the only one I ever identified with...
                                  because *everyone* always wants to play
                                  him/her I've never been *able* to play
                                  Ranma... I appreciate your feelings on that
                                  point, but... ::shrugs:: I'd rather play an
                                  original character in a Ranma RP then have to
                                  play a character I don't connect with... I
                                  don't mind playing multiple characters, to
                                  help with the supporting cast, but... it's
                                  hard to stay interested if I am *only* playing
                                  one of the supporting cast... I wouldn't mind
                                  playing Akane at times, and sometimes I don't
                                  mind playing Ukyo, but... their characters'
                                  are pretty limiting... Shampoo can be fun,
                                  but... I have a hard time doing the broken
                                  speech! ::giggles::

AV         8/7/01   12:14 AM and to be brutally honest, I don't have enough
                                  respect for Roland to stand for him always
                                  playing Ranma... I am sorry to say it, but his
                                  role playing is so bad that he just kills the
                                  character!

Kaori-Chan 8/7/01   12:15 AM .
                                  
                                  Okay, I'll forgive you because you haven't
                                  roleplayed much on IRC.... but WTF?
                                  
                                  There are not "SUPPORTING" cast members in an
                                  RPG.
                                  
                                  There are people who involve themselves, and
                                  people who don't... you can take the spotlight
                                  as any character besides Ranma, and have some
                                  involvement in the story.
                                  
                                  

Kaori-Chan 8/7/01   12:17 AM "Do not speak of the splinter in your

                                  than the normal nabsie.

AV         8/7/01   12:17 AM gee... if that's true, then why is it that
                                  people only want to play Ranma?

Kaori-Chan 8/7/01   12:18 AM Because they're morons.
                                  
                                  It's either Ranma or Akane.  Most serious
                                  roleplayers realize they can take any
                                  character and make it their own, make the
                                  character important rather than just
                                  occassional slapstick...
                                  
                                  but a heck of a lot of people only want to
                                  play Ranma or Akane, because they lack some
                                  understanding of what freeform roleplaying is.

AV         8/7/01   12:19 AM moi?

Kaori-Chan 8/7/01   12:20 AM People want to play the major characters
                                  because they're the major characters.... such
                                  as Ranma or Akane.
                                  
                                  But then you throw in Urd, and Skuld, and
                                  Gohan, and Frieza, and a plethora of other
                                  anime characters and major character roles
                                  become fundamentally meaningless.
                                  
                                  This is also true with a room full of talented
                                  roleplayers.

AV         8/7/01   12:34 AM "People want to play the major characters

                                  I'd say that's more than enough corroboration
                                  of my own reference to the majority of
                                  characters in Ranma 1/2 as "supporting"
                                  characters... that's how people think of them,
                                  even in an RP... particularily in a Ranma
                                  RP... it's sort of a given that Ranma always
                                  upstages everyone around him
                                  
                                  Like you, I was drawn to Ranma for very deep,
                                  very personal reasons... I identified with him
                                  in a lot of ways, though it is an inverse sort
                                  of reflection... for him, there was a physical
                                  transformation, for me it was, for most of my
                                  teen years, a spiritual transformation from
                                  male to female that I struggled with for my
                                  teen age years... for a long time I could not
                                  understand why I flipped back and forth
                                  between male and female in my head, and I used
                                  to fight it desperately for fear I was going
                                  insane... but, I also was wishing I had that
                                  very "curse" from the moment I entered
                                  puberty... so in a sense, getting to play
                                  Ranma is a chance for me to make that "dream"
                                  come true
                                  
                                  to be honest, in many ways I hate Ranma 1/2,
                                  because... it's like having my secret,
                                  deepest, darkest desires stolen and then sold
                                  to the world... I can't really even write the
                                  stories I started in my head as a teen,
                                  because people will take one look at them and
                                  think they are nothing but Ranma rip offs

Kaori-Chan 8/7/01   12:38 AM If you think Roland is not good at playing
                                  Ranma, then point out what he does wrong so he
                                  can improve....
                                  
                                  I'm not gonna just give away Ranma to someone
                                  else and tell roland, "Sorry, can't play him
                                  anymore", even if it's for you.
                                  
                                  Me, I always played original characters,
                                  because I understood the originals far too
                                  well for me to play them.
                                  
                                  I would've easily turned any of them into a
                                  major player, because i know how to work their
                                  personalities.

AV         8/7/01   12:39 AM in some ways, I know better than to play
                                  Ranma, because... to do him right is to go
                                  against the grain of my own character... he is
                                  very much a male, and hates to be female...
                                  that's a very difficult thing for me to
                                  play... in truth, I'd probably be best playing
                                  the opposite of Ranma. A girl who was cursed
                                  to turn into a boy...

AV         8/7/01   12:39 AM I don't "have" to play Ranma... I just have
                                  this intense identification with him

Kaori-Chan 8/7/01   12:40 AM that's another reason why I wouldn't want you
                                  playing Ranma, YOU wouldn't do him well.  At
                                  least roland FIGHTS Ranma becoming female,
                                  because he knows Ranma WOULD.

AV         8/7/01   12:40 AM mostly because of the curse

Kaori-Chan 8/7/01   12:40 AM you're contradicting yourself, you said if you
                                  were going to play you wanted to play ranma or
                                  an original.
                                  
                                  So what, there will only be RANMA and no other
                                  cast members? What then?

AV         8/7/01   12:43 AM ::sighs:: you don't get it... because I have a
                                  kind of connection to Ranma, the prospect of
                                  playing Ranma gives me a real interest in
                                  participating... I don't really expect anyone
                                  to allow me to do what I really want, which is
                                  play an original character with a gender based
                                  curse... Ukyo is sort of right, but... I...
                                  the whole okonomiaki theme she comes with is
                                  totally uninteresting to me

AV         8/7/01   12:44 AM I like her personality, I like her own
                                  "gender" issues... but I simply cannot summon
                                  the kind of devotion and enthusiasm to
                                  okonomiaki necessary to her character

Kaori-Chan 8/7/01   12:46 AM it sounds as though you need to learn a lot of
                                  things from me.
                                  
                                  Not to mention things about cooperation and
                                  roleplaying.

AV         8/7/01   12:47 AM I have only seen you playing Kaoru... and I
                                  have only seen you "getting your way" with the
                                  Master PC

Kaori-Chan 8/7/01   12:49 AM yeah, and how often have you played with me,
                                  mmmm???

AV         8/7/01   12:52 AM not often... but, you're making a lot of
                                  judgements about me based on as little
                                  exposure
                                  
                                  I'm just being honest with you about what I
                                  think and what I feel... and I am accepting
                                  the same thing from you... you've stated
                                  plainly that for the most part you're only
                                  concerned about your own satisfaction, and
                                  hey, that's cool... I won't give you any crap
                                  over it... since it's obvious that I'm gonna
                                  have to see to my own satisfaction, I don't
                                  think I am out of line kicking the matter over
                                  looking for an angle that allows me to get
                                  some mutual pleasure out of the activity

Kaori-Chan 8/7/01   12:54 AM it'll never happen unless you participate...
                                  
                                  not to mention, it might be a better idea to
                                  just roleplay more with me to get a feel of
                                  what I'm talking about.
                                  
                                  it takes a couple months to even get an idea
                                  of what my roleplaying style is.

AV         8/7/01   12:57 AM it'll never happen unless you reciprocate... I
                                  don't *need* this... I have more then enough
                                  to spend my time on without adding long hours
                                  even a short online RP requires... I would
                                  like to have some fun, and that is enough
                                  reason to take the time to play... but, I am
                                  still trying to decide if this will *be* any
                                  fun for me, or if it'll just be a lot of work
                                  to make you happy that will leave me drained
                                  and unsatisfied

Kaori-Chan 8/7/01   12:58 AM you don't want, that's fine... but it'll be
                                  something of a barrier between us.

AV         8/7/01   1:00 AM  if I just didn't *want* to, I wouldn't have
                                  spent all this time talking to you about it...
                                  I'd just say, no thanks, doesn't sound like
                                  fun. I don't have a lot to go on here... don't
                                  be upset at me for trying to feel you out on
                                  this.

Kaori-Chan 8/7/01   1:02 AM  talk is cheap... wanna feel me out, only way
                                  to do it is to experience firsthand.
                                  
                                  I told roland I wasn't going to roleplay with
                                  him because, well, I wanted to roleplay with
                                  you...
                                  
                                  then I told him maybe you'd like to play with
                                  both of us, maybe...
                                  
                                  now it's been 3 hours, and we've gone nowhere.

AV         8/7/01   1:03 AM  oh shit... I am sorry, I didn't realize you
                                  meant *tonight*

Kaori-Chan 8/7/01   1:04 AM  yeah.  Whoops.

AV         8/7/01   1:04 AM  I was thinking it was too late to start a
                                  game... I assumed it was sort of something
                                  we'd hash out tonight and then meet earlier in
                                  the evening the next day or something to do

AV         8/7/01   1:04 AM  I am so sorry

Kaori-Chan 8/7/01   1:04 AM  Alex, I like talking with you... but not all
                                  the time.  not *********ALL********* the time.

AV         8/7/01   1:07 AM  oh man... the thing is... I'd been thinking
                                  about talking you into doing some role playing
                                  and I had all these ideas of a sort of hentai
                                  campaign adventure... sort of like writing a
                                  story together over a couple of months, a way
                                  to really *do* something together... and when
                                  this came up I went off on trying to see what
                                  you'd think of it, but never telling you what
                                  my original idea was

AV         8/7/01   1:08 AM  ::scuffs her toe on the ground, looking down::

Kaori-Chan 8/7/01   1:09 AM  I really love talking to you... but you're my
                                  girl, and I want to share something I love
                                  with you, but you probably would react badly
                                  or just not want to go along with it...
                                  
                                  

AV         8/7/01   1:10 AM  what?

AV         8/7/01   1:10 AM  or are you still talking about HRP?

Kaori-Chan 8/7/01   1:11 AM  yes, I am still talking about RP.  

AV         8/7/01   1:11 AM  oh, okay

AV         8/7/01   1:14 AM  well... I don't mind playing in a Ranma RP,
                                  and I don't even mind playing one of the
                                  regular cast, Roland can keep on playing
                                  Ranma, but... I'd like to have an original
                                  character for my primary character. Is that
                                  okay with you?

Kaori-Chan 8/7/01   1:15 AM  I'll ask what I once used to ask others... can
                                  you handle two characters and post fast enough
                                  while still going into detail?

AV         8/7/01   1:18 AM  I can only type 45-60 words per minute,
                                  however I *am* able to keep multiple
                                  personalities running side by side in my
                                  head... considering how "wordy" I can get,
                                  dividing my input time between the two
                                  characters might keep that from getting out of
                                  hand... I *can* easily keep up interaction
                                  between the two characters I am running, so
                                  I'd have no trouble keeping a scene flowing on
                                  my own

Kaori-Chan 8/7/01   1:19 AM  so who would you play? A girl with a curse?

AV         8/7/01   1:22 AM  the idea that I had was that this girl was
                                  cursed at a very young age by her father, who
                                  wanted to have a male heir, and went to the
                                  trouble to lock her curse... so, say she's the
                                  same age as Ranma, she's been a boy for nine
                                  or ten years, but she knows that she *was* a
                                  girl (her father forced her to pretend to be a
                                  boy for the first seven years or so, then
                                  found out about Jusenkyo and the Chisuiiton)
                                  and wants to unlock her curse so she can *be*
                                  a girl at least part time

Kaori-Chan 8/7/01   1:24 AM  that sounds like more of a serious RP idea,
                                  however...

AV         8/7/01   1:24 AM  now, the Chisuiiton is still in Japan, buried
                                  in the rubble of that mountain... but, the
                                  Master PC can probably show that she really is
                                  a girl cursed to be a boy, and can probably
                                  unlock it if commanded to do so

AV         8/7/01   1:25 AM  for the moment, the Master PC is enough for
                                  what we are doing... but, her quest to unlock
                                  her curse does serve to bring her looking for
                                  Ranma who she may have heard had found it (and
                                  who might be pursuaded to allow her to use it)

Kaori-Chan 8/7/01   1:25 AM  ranma doesn't know about the PC.  ^^;

Kaori-Chan 8/7/01   1:26 AM  Come talk to Roland about it, see what he
                                  thinks.. he's on Ranmania on starchat.

AV         8/7/01   1:26 AM  grrr... I didn't say he did! I said, who ever
                                  has it would be able to figure out her secret
                                  and might decide on his own to do something
                                  about it... my girl is only looking for Ranma
                                  to see if he still has the chisuiiton

AV         8/7/01   2:03 AM  it's 2:00 I gotta head off to bed

Kaori-Chan 8/7/01   2:03 AM  uhuh.  =\

AV         8/7/01   2:04 AM  well... I'll give my character some thought
                                  and try to get on starchat by 9... G'night,
                                  Love
                                  sweet dreams

Kaori-Chan 8/7/01   2:05 AM  goodnight.

AV         8/7/01   8:46 PM  Hey you... I logged in to StarChat to see if
                                  you guys had already gotten started...

AV         8/7/01   8:46 PM  Maybe I was too early, but I wanted to inform
                                  you that I might not be able to play
                                  tonight...

AV         8/7/01   8:49 PM  ... 
                                  
                                  okay, guess you're not at your computer at the
                                  moment... I have to fix myself some dinner,
                                  and Launce rented some movies for us to watch,
                                  which is like the first time in a couple of
                                  weeks we've rented anything... I will try to
                                  check in a few times with you later

Kaori-Chan 8/7/01   10:30 PM *Sighs*
                                  
                                  I was SLEEPING.

AV         8/7/01   10:38 PM oh... well... I still have a movie to watch...
                                  want me to check back with you in a couple of
                                  hours?

Kaori-Chan 8/7/01   10:38 PM no....
                                  
                                  if you want to go watch your movie, go watch
                                  it.

AV         8/7/01   10:38 PM okay...

AV         8/7/01   10:39 PM talk to you later...

Kaori-Chan 8/7/01   10:39 PM maybe.

AV         8/7/01   10:40 PM this is really bothering you, isn't is?

AV         8/7/01   10:40 PM it... sigh

Kaori-Chan 8/7/01   10:41 PM No, really? Every night, a book, a movie, a
                                  website.  Guess I'm pretty low on the priority
                                  list...
                                  
                                  but that's okay, I'll get over it and forgive
                                  you, I always do because I'm that much of a
                                  pansy.

AV         8/7/01   10:43 PM sigh... I never said I was perfect...
                                  
                                  I hope you do forgive me... I have been trying
                                  to be more considerate of you... I just... I
                                  am easily distracted

Kaori-Chan 8/7/01   10:46 PM yes, and why should I care? This will keep
                                  happening, since you are so distractable. 
                                  I'll be here waiting, and you'll be off
                                  distracting yourself from depressive thoughts.
                                  
                                  

AV         8/7/01   10:47 PM I am going to take that... I deserve it

Kaori-Chan 8/7/01   10:48 PM Yes you do.  I'm not going to talk about me,
                                  and how much *I* want you to at least visit
                                  once in a damn blue moon...
                                  
                                  This is your choice, and you can live with it
                                  if you want to keep it up.  I'll be here, and
                                  I'll keep taking it from you... so you think
                                  about that.

Kaori-Chan 8/7/01   10:49 PM In any and every relationship I have had, I
                                  would endure misery and pain to be with that
                                  person, and I would always come back for more
                                  misery and pain because I cared.

AV         8/7/01   10:55 PM I will think about it... I don't want to hurt
                                  you... I hope that really matters enough to me
                                  to change some very old habits... that's not
                                  easy, and I won't pretend it will be... oh, I
                                  keep telling myself I am going to change my
                                  ways, but when the time comes to actually do
                                  the things I need to do my mind blanks out all
                                  those good intentions... maybe deep down
                                  inside I don't want anyone to love me... maybe
                                  *I* am just to lazy to make a real effort,
                                  it's so much easier to disappoint people than
                                  try to please them... people can be so hard to
                                  please most of the time... whatever the
                                  explanation is, I think it's safe to say I've
                                  got my own pathetic issues... ::hangs her
                                  head::

Kaori-Chan 8/7/01   10:58 PM what were you expecting to do, huh?  Come
                                  online for just a bit before going and
                                  watching the movies with Launce?  Oh, wait, I
                                  remember.. you said something about not
                                  roleplaying tonight.  I guess that was why...
                                  
                                  There are some things that irritate me to no
                                  end.  My mother makes plans based on a perfect
                                  world and thus stresses herself because the
                                  world is not perfect.... I also hate people
                                  making plans and then going back on their
                                  decision.  I'm sure there's a hypocrisy in
                                  there somewhere, but I'm only saying how I
                                  feel about it.

AV         8/7/01   11:05 PM I will be brutally honest, Mark... right now I
                                  am burnt out and tired of *everything*
                                  
                                  All I want at the moment is to lay back and be
                                  entertained by something that does not demand
                                  any effort on my part... because I really
                                  don't have the energy for any exertions of my
                                  own... it's not that I don't want to spend
                                  time with you... it's just that I can't just
                                  kick back and chat with you, I have to sit in
                                  this really uncomfortable chair, squiting at
                                  my glowing monitor through the mounting
                                  headache, and translate all my thoughts and
                                  feelings through my fingers... I get all wound
                                  up and stressed, completely out of
                                  proportion... 
                                  
                                  what I really want is to slip into a coma and
                                  not have to come out of it until some of the
                                  shit in my life has been straightened out and
                                  makes sense... I am so *fucking* tired, Mark!
                                  I just want to *quit*

Kaori-Chan 8/7/01   11:06 PM You're familiar enough with the boy who cried
                                  wolf that I won't have to quote anything for
                                  you.
                                  
                                  What will tomorrows reason be?  The more it
                                  happens, the more callous and rude I get to
                                  you.

AV         8/7/01   11:07 PM ... right... I'll talk to you later... I hope

Kaori-Chan 8/7/01   11:08 PM I am sorry if I hurt you by saying it, alex,
                                  but honestly what do you expect?

AV         8/8/01   4:33 AM  that's fine, I understand perfectly... my
                                  apologies for not getting back to you for so
                                  long... 
                                  
                                  as it happens, I didn't go watch a movie...
                                  instead, Launce pulled me aside and spent a
                                  great deal of time trying to help me make some
                                  sense of my life... that was a good thing,
                                  because I really needed it
                                  
                                  I don't know where things are going to go from
                                  here, and I sure hope neither you nor I get
                                  hurt along the way. I am not going to try to
                                  push you away, and I am going to find some way
                                  to spend more quality time with you. I also
                                  have a lot of shit in my life to get
                                  straightened out, and I will try to keep that
                                  from interfering between you and I. I really
                                  can't expect to spend four to six hours every
                                  night talking to you, but I certainly can be
                                  more accessible and for two or three nights a
                                  week, there should be no reason not to spend
                                  as much time as possible having some kind of
                                  fun with you.
                                  
                                  I am working on it, my love... I am working on

Kaori-Chan 8/8/01   4:34 AM  Don't worry, I'm not upset... it is just
                                  irksome, it gets to me when it keeps
                                  happening.  Otherwise, I can understand
                                  spending time apart.

AV         8/8/01   4:36 AM  you'll have to forgive me... I am not an
                                  overtly selfish person, but in these quiet,
                                  annoying ways I am perversely self centered...

Kaori-Chan 8/8/01   4:37 AM  that's the only thing I can ask... and it's
                                  surely not a guarantee.

AV         8/8/01   4:41 AM  perhaps I can't guarantee anything, but I do
                                  have it firmly in mind... I don't much care to
                                  be a flake, and one way or another I will
                                  cease to be one! ::laughing:: I won't succeed

                                  now, I am working very hard on not letting
                                  things get to me so much that I must
                                  constantly fall prey to distractions...

                                  hemulen.starchat.net

AV         8/9/01   12:15 AM err... it finally went thru... but if it
                                  proves to be lagged I might switch over to
                                  that...

Kaori-Chan 8/9/01   12:15 AM that's the server I am on.  ^^;

AV         8/9/01   12:15 AM I seem to be logged in through paris

AV         8/9/01   3:05 AM  hey... I got disconnected, and took a while to

AV         8/9/01   3:11 AM  crap crap crap!

AV         8/9/01   7:28 PM  okay... see you tomorrow then

Kaori-Chan 8/9/01   8:17 PM  Heya Hon, just talked to Roland... it's about
                                  7:20pm, both of us are pretty tired this
                                  afternoon, so we likely aren't going to be
                                  online to RP.  ^>^

AV         8/10/01  7:11 PM  Good evening! I'm gonna be going out to see a
                                  movie tonight, just wanted to give you fair
                                  warning...
                                  How are you doing?

Kaori-Chan 8/10/01  7:12 PM  okay I suppose, woke up early this morning but
                                  at least I slept through the night.

AV         8/10/01  7:14 PM  that's good... Steve was just getting up when
                                  I finally went off to bed... I didn't get up
                                  until about 3:30p! Yai!
                                  I hope you feel nice and well rested... I'll
                                  be here for a little bit, I think

Kaori-Chan 8/10/01  7:15 PM  =\
                                  
                                  Urr... why did you stay up the entire night
                                  again?

AV         8/10/01  7:17 PM  I have no idea! The time just slipped by me,
                                  and when Steve got on I finally noticed the
                                  time... I suppose it's not exactly my fault. I
                                  was... way lost in thought and organizing
                                  files on my computer

AV         8/10/01  7:18 PM  well... I guess I won't be here for as long as
                                  I thought... we're leaving in a few minutes so
                                  we can stop for dinner on the way...

Kaori-Chan 8/10/01  7:21 PM  Well... later I guess.

AV         8/10/01  7:23 PM  ::smiles:: It'll be for the good... I've been
                                  cooped up in the house for too long... I'll

                                  want to RP tomorrow... I might even want to
                                  start early... well, earlier than I've been
                                  getting on for some time!

                                  It doesn't look like Roland is online right
                                  now...

Kaori-Chan 8/12/01  9:52 PM  nah, he said he might wake up later, that was
                                  at 6.

AV         8/12/01  9:53 PM  ah... well... I hope he doesn't wait *too*

                                  mood anyway, hmmm?

Kaori-Chan 8/12/01  10:01 PM somewhat.  Seems lately a lot of american men
                                  are becoming less shy about the fact that they
                                  surf for porn and such on the net.... what do
                                  you think? Is that a true statement?

AV         8/12/01  10:05 PM err... I wouldn't know... none of the guys
                                  I've known were the least bit ashamed to chase
                                  porn, but, most of them are somewhat discrete
                                  about it... I don't see it as a problem,
                                  really... as long as the girls are willing and
                                  are making a good chunk of the money... there
                                  are enough girls *willing* to pose that no one
                                  needs to be forcing girls into it, and that
                                  would be the only bad thing about it...
                                  
                                  does this have anything to do with the site I
                                  directed you to?

Kaori-Chan 8/12/01  10:07 PM no.  

AV         8/12/01  10:09 PM oh... alright then... now, as for me, I am
                                  pretty mum about what's going on in my head
                                  when it comes to porn, but I trust you... I
                                  think you might understand why I look at that
                                  kind of stuff

Kaori-Chan 8/12/01  10:12 PM envy/desire to be who you look at?
                                  

AV         8/12/01  10:13 PM yep! got it in one! ::smiles and hugs you

                                  for the most part, I've just been standing
                                  there and taking my punches... I've been
                                  learning that I just can't put things in words
                                  well enough to explain what I am doing or why
                                  I am doing it, what I understand and how it
                                  works... Launce has been trying to kick me
                                  awake, reminding me that in the absence of a
                                  miracle I still have to survive in this
                                  world... I don't really need anyone to remind
                                  me, but, I don't think he's trying to
                                  discourage me or convince me to change my
                                  designs... he's been trying to point out
                                  different ways of coping... I don't mind, he's
                                  not really interfering, just trying to help in
                                  the way his own experience allows him to... I
                                  always listen, and if there is something
                                  useful, I'll try to use it
                                  
                                  there is nothing, nothing at all, I would put
                                  before my promise to myself, nor which I would
                                  abandon my promise for... as for progress, the
                                  only way I can explain it is like... adjusting
                                  my grip on reality
                                  
                                  just because I can't explain myself to other
                                  people (who don't really care anyways, apart
                                  from you) does not mean that I am wrong...
                                  just putting this stuff in words is taking a
                                  step in the wrong direction, so I don't freak
                                  out when people don't get it and turn around
                                  and tell me I am simply wrong

Kaori-Chan 8/13/01  5:27 PM  wow, you're on early!!!

AV         8/13/01  5:27 PM  yep! howz you?

Kaori-Chan 8/13/01  5:27 PM  I'm alive.  I hope I was not acting too
                                  strange last night.

AV         8/13/01  5:28 PM  if you didn't act strange occasionally I think
                                  I'd be worried about you... I am okay, really

Kaori-Chan 8/13/01  5:29 PM  I didn't upset you or hurt your feelings, did
                                  I?

AV         8/13/01  5:33 PM  there are some things that are by nature going
                                  to be upsetting or alarming, but I've been
                                  through enough not to let these things get to
                                  me... if there if a point to it, something
                                  important for me to know or consider, I try to
                                  calm down and look for that... I don't always
                                  manage to keep my cool, but I do try to
                                  moderate my reactions... you have the logs
                                  from last night, so even if you don't remember
                                  what Allen said to me, you can easily find
                                  out... I tried not to take it the wrong way
                                  
                                  I've got it sorted out well enough that I can
                                  talk about it now, so, no hard feelings here

Kaori-Chan 8/13/01  5:35 PM  It's a bit sketchy, I was very tired at the
                                  time or I'd remember better.  ^>^;;
                                  
                                  Did he say anything important or enlightening?

AV         8/13/01  5:42 PM  you know, sometimes that is very hard to
                                  judge... he said a number of things that are
                                  way above par for this world, but not enough
                                  on those lines for me to really see how he
                                  thinks, what angle of approach he has to the
                                  truth... that slight difference of perspective
                                  was enough for what he was saying to me to be
                                  far more alarming than what he meant... once I
                                  got past my reaction to the way he said it, I
                                  had a much clearer idea of what he was really
                                  saying, and... really, he was just looking out
                                  for you

Kaori-Chan 8/13/01  5:44 PM  really? I recall vaguely some of what he said,
                                  though not exactly.

AV         8/13/01  5:52 PM  he touched on something very important, when
                                  he presented me with a hypothetical
                                  decision... to choose between my love for you
                                  and my true identity... and that's, for me, a
                                  very unfair position to be put in, because...
                                  well, I don't think I can explain the hell
                                  I've been through over a tendancy to put other
                                  people before myself, and how brutally it's
                                  been nailed into my head that if I fail myself
                                  I cannot help but fail others... but, in the
                                  terms of the question he posed to me, I don't
                                  think he was asking for me to betray myself in
                                  making this choice... I don't think he
                                  realized how much I was primed to interpret
                                  such a question in that way... for him, what
                                  he was asking was if I loved you enough to put
                                  you first... 
                                  
                                  that's not precisely it, but... this is all
                                  very hard to put in words... I'll keep at it
                                  until I get it right, but I'm not going to
                                  obsess over it

Kaori-Chan 8/13/01  5:53 PM  From what I recall, I think what he meant for
                                  you to think about is what you want and what
                                  your priorities are.

AV         8/13/01  5:56 PM  yes... put most simply, that's what he was up
                                  to

Kaori-Chan 8/13/01  5:56 PM  I dunno, did he help?

AV         8/13/01  5:57 PM  I'll let you know... for now I am still
                                  thinking about it...

Kaori-Chan 8/13/01  5:58 PM  kay.  *hugs*

AV         8/13/01  5:59 PM  this is something that I want to discuss
                                  *with* you, and not just mull over in my head

Kaori-Chan 8/13/01  6:00 PM  urr.. okay.  *Blinkies*

AV         8/13/01  6:02 PM  ::smiles and holds you close::
                                  
                                  this does require talking about the things
                                  going on deep in my mind, and before I talk
                                  about it I want to ask you not to be afraid of
                                  what it all means... okay?

AV         8/13/01  6:04 PM  we don't have to start now, if you aren't up
                                  to it...

Kaori-Chan 8/13/01  6:04 PM  no, it's okay... I'm good if you want to talk
                                  about it, and I'll try and behave emotions
                                  wise.

AV         8/13/01  6:11 PM  okay, that's good...
                                  
                                  Thanks to Allen I sat up last night and went
                                  over the things I didn't want to look at too
                                  closely over the past month or more... and I
                                  realized that at some point I became afraid of
                                  being hurt by you, or worse of hurting you...
                                  when I first met you I thought you were
                                  perfect, and you can recall how you tried to
                                  show me that you were far from perfect... I
                                  could still see in you the things that I loved
                                  and which made you seem perfect to me, but I
                                  did start to ask myself questions... yes, I
                                  loved you just the way you were, but I have
                                  always had exquisite taste in things, and I
                                  could not honestly say I didn't sometimes want
                                  more than you might want to give me or more
                                  than you could bear to indulge me in... 
                                  
                                  little things like that I had to look at and
                                  be honest with myself about... and that made
                                  me realize that I... I do actually want
                                  things, and I do suffer from disappointment if
                                  I cannot pursue those things... my love for
                                  you would keep these things from ever taking
                                  control of me, but there would be room for
                                  resentment, and that gave me caution
                                  
                                  but that was only part of it...

AV         8/13/01  6:12 PM  in one way you actually scared me... and...
                                  while I can admit it to myself, it is very
                                  very hard to mention it to you...

Kaori-Chan 8/13/01  6:13 PM  *is listening*

AV         8/13/01  6:13 PM  as happy as I was to find you, my other
                                  half... it demanded of me the most difficult
                                  admission

AV         8/13/01  6:15 PM  in finding my other half I had to recognize
                                  that I was not, and could not be, whole on my
                                  own... and I can't explain why that thought
                                  frightens me... but I know that it is true...
                                  I am a whole person, as whole a person as I
                                  have ever heard of, but there is no denying
                                  that you are what completes me... you are the
                                  one thing I simply cannot be, no matter how
                                  hard I try

Kaori-Chan 8/13/01  6:17 PM  a raging social outcast pervert? =D

AV         8/13/01  6:21 PM  you are the man of my dreams... you are, in
                                  mind and soul and spirit the man I have always
                                  dreamed of... a healthy, adventurous male
                                  spirit which is totally unashamed to explore
                                  his erotic limits, even to the point of being
                                  a girl! and it's not your fault that the world
                                  around you cannot deal with your mischeif...
                                  you aren't the kind of man to worry much about
                                  it, just to be careful not to give mrs. grundy
                                  any ammunition to shoot you with... 

AV         8/13/01  6:23 PM  you recognize the risks and dangers of your
                                  appetites and take the necessary caution...
                                  granted, if you were in a position where no
                                  one could threaten you, you might get  bit out
                                  of control for a bit, but you would get a grip
                                  on it for your own self respect... you sort of
                                  hate the thought of what you might do with
                                  your first taste of power, but you don't deny
                                  that you would love to get all those pent up
                                  frustrations out of your system... you'd do
                                  pennance for it later, but... no one would be
                                  as hard on you about it as you would be on
                                  yourself

Kaori-Chan 8/13/01  6:24 PM  I suppose that would be true.

AV         8/13/01  6:25 PM  the things you worry about frightening me,
                                  those parts of yourself that no one else can
                                  respect or tolerate... those are no the things
                                  about you that scare me... excite me, yes...
                                  what frightens me about you is that thought
                                  that... you might *own* me... and that I would
                                  let you...

Kaori-Chan 8/13/01  6:28 PM  if that is true, it is also true that you
                                  would in a sense own me... perhaps not in the
                                  conventional sense of the word, since my views
                                  of relationships are certainly not normal or
                                  socially acceptable at times.

AV         8/13/01  6:34 PM  yes, that makes sense... though why I don't
                                  think of it... I suppose I am really serious
                                  about not trying to bend you to my will, to
                                  make you into something you're not just to
                                  please myself... which simply means that I
                                  have a healthy control and manipulation
                                  streak, and would sometimes get off on
                                  control-transformation-manipulation games
                                  myself--and therefore keep a very tight leash
                                  on that part of myself ::grinning::
                                  
                                  so, by the numbers we begin to get closer to
                                  the root of the problem... 

Kaori-Chan 8/13/01  6:36 PM  problem?

AV         8/13/01  6:40 PM  when I once thought of finding my true love
                                  and soul mate, I was thinking of what would
                                  be, in essence, my equal and opposite... you
                                  fit me better than that, but we both know what
                                  I am trying to do... and that implies a degree
                                  of power which does nasty things to
                                  perceptions of equality... 
                                  
                                  I don't want to be an all powerful goddess if
                                  you can't be an all powerful god... not
                                  because you, as a man, are not good enough for
                                  me... only because, I can't stand to in any
                                  way belittle you, and I am dearly afraid
                                  that... ::words fail me::

Kaori-Chan 8/13/01  7:18 PM  *laughs* Mm.. Roland has been asking for RP
                                  you know.

AV         8/13/01  7:18 PM  really? that's good... I was hoping he'd be up
                                  to it tonight

Kaori-Chan 8/13/01  7:19 PM  really? Wow.  ^^;

AV         8/13/01  7:20 PM  surprised? I've been raring to go for a couple
                                  of nights... I hoped we'd do some last night, 
                                  but I don't think roland was up... ::shrugs
                                  and looks at you eagerly::

Kaori-Chan 8/13/01  7:21 PM  *Smiles* We're on IRC hon.

                                  You know that I love you?

AV         8/13/01  7:21 PM  okay... I need a few minutes to clean up from
                                  dinner and I'll be on, K?

Kaori-Chan 8/13/01  7:22 PM  *Smiles and nods*

AV         8/13/01  7:50 PM  okay... I am back... had a few extra chores to
                                  do... see you on irc 

Kaori-Chan 8/14/01  10:22 PM hey sweety.... I just wanted to tell you I'm
                                  pretty tired tonight, but that I wanted to
                                  make sure you knew I wasn't going to be
                                  online.  *kisses* I love you so very much,
                                  Alex... and I believe in you.

AV         8/15/01  11:08 PM I was just coming on to tell you the same...
                                  long day, got up early and am very tired!
                                  ::hugs:: I love you!

Kaori-Chan 8/15/01  11:08 PM uhh, that message is from last night.

AV         8/15/01  11:09 PM oh! yikes... last night I came upstairs, hit
                                  the bed and passed out!

Kaori-Chan 8/15/01  11:09 PM I'm still here, at least, for now I am.

AV         8/15/01  11:10 PM mmmm....that's good. how was your day?

Kaori-Chan 8/15/01  11:11 PM eeeh, it was okay.  Played some Chrono
                                  Trigger, spurred by finishing Chrono Cross...
                                  which I found to be a disappointing game in
                                  the end.

AV         8/15/01  11:16 PM that's too bad... I hope something better
                                  comes along. I spent the day reading a romance
                                  novel for research and watching the girls... I
                                  also had to go over some press releases for
                                  Cloak & Gamer, Launce's game review site...
                                  he's asked me to take over reporting on those,
                                  he's also asked me to do some work for his web
                                  design company, submitting bids and doing
                                  custom graphics... which means I'd be getting
                                  paid a little occasionally...
                                  
                                  if I really had the knack for gaming, or a
                                  system powerful to run the more modern games,
                                  I'd probably also be asked to do some game
                                  reviews... 

AV         8/15/01  11:18 PM for now, that's all little stuff... getting a
                                  romance novel written is my big project at the
                                  moment... and even that's just to pass the
                                  time mostly... ::sighs and rolls her eyes::

Kaori-Chan 8/15/01  11:18 PM romance novels... hmph..

AV         8/15/01  11:19 PM girl porn... and for 5,000 bucks a pop, not a
                                  bad racket to get into, sort of like becoming
                                  a crack dealer ::laughing::

Kaori-Chan 8/15/01  11:20 PM only $5,000? =\

AV         8/15/01  11:21 PM well, the average book is like 200 to 250
                                  pages, and with a working plot that's only
                                  about 2 weeks worth of work... and I *could*
                                  use the money... I can't remember the last
                                  time I made 5K in a month anyway...

Kaori-Chan 8/15/01  11:22 PM I'm gonna go to bed...  

AV         8/15/01  11:22 PM ::smiles and pulls you in for a tight
                                  embrace:: awww... I scared you off!
                                  ::laughing::

Kaori-Chan 8/15/01  11:24 PM *bows* Most sincere apologies, Madame, but I
                                  think... well, not much of Romance novels.

AV         8/15/01  11:26 PM you're forgiven... I kinda like reading them,
                                  I've been at it for years, and considering how
                                  picky I am with fantasy and science fiction
                                  it's much simpler and more straight forward
                                  writing, little brain power needed to write,
                                  and for now a way to make some money while I
                                  am wandering lost

AV         8/15/01  11:27 PM that and Launce knows some people inside,
                                  which could help me actually get them
                                  published... ::shrugs::

Kaori-Chan 8/15/01  11:28 PM I am to intellectual to appreciate such
                                  things, I suppose.  *Bows* Pardon my arrogance
                                  and presumptuousness.

AV         8/15/01  11:29 PM well, you're a guy... you're just not wired
                                  for it, I guess... ::kisses you gently::

Kaori-Chan 8/15/01  11:33 PM ....
                                  
                                  you and I did not speak when I was pursuing my
                                  female life.  I am dualistic... even as a
                                  female, though, my willpower was very strong
                                  and fiery.
                                  
                                  so please... do not talk about wiring.  I at
                                  times still feel it appropriate for myself to
                                  pursue womanhood.

AV         8/15/01  11:37 PM ah, but I did not mean it in that sense...
                                  sorry if that felt like a slap... I did not
                                  mean to imply that only a true girl
                                  appreciates romance novels... and I did not
                                  mean *hard* wired... ::hugs you tight,
                                  reassuringly and protectively:: 

Kaori-Chan 8/15/01  11:38 PM you might take care what words you use.

AV         8/15/01  11:41 PM sorry, I was in a playful mood... I guess I
                                  thought you'd take it as an inside joke... you
                                  know how much I cherish your feminine side... 

Kaori-Chan 8/15/01  11:41 PM ......
                                  
                                  I am going to go to sleep... I am a bit
                                  irritable.

Kaori-Chan 8/16/01  10:13 PM lo lo lo.

AV         8/16/01  10:29 PM hi, was off in the kitchen scavenging...

Kaori-Chan 8/16/01  10:30 PM ahhh... were you wanting to talk to me about
                                  something?

AV         8/16/01  10:30 PM nothing on my mind, just wanted to be
                                  sociable... finally got to talk to Candice
                                  tonight...

Kaori-Chan 8/16/01  10:31 PM Candice?

AV         8/16/01  10:31 PM I seem to be waning fast... ::shakes her
                                  head:: I mean, Ldy_Kiara of course, Candice is
                                  her real name... ::smiles::

Kaori-Chan 8/16/01  10:32 PM aaah, well, that's good.  ^>^ She say anything
                                  bout me?

AV         8/16/01  10:34 PM I talked about you, and she brought me a
                                  little up to date on her boyfriend/fiance, his
                                  father and their cats... they've adopted a
                                  fourth since I last saw them... she was wiped
                                  out, working hard, then working out, staying
                                  up late reading, so we only talked for a few
                                  minutes, not enough time to get into detail

Kaori-Chan 8/16/01  10:35 PM okay.  ^>^  You're tired too, huh?  Getting on
                                  some sort of normal schedule?

AV         8/16/01  10:37 PM I don't know what's up with me... I know it
                                  was real hot today, I think it just sapped my
                                  energy... I couldn't sleep last night, and
                                  woke up about 3 in the afternoon, and I still
                                  feel wasted ::sigh:: I could probably zone in
                                  front of the tv okay for a few hours, but I
                                  was zoning after one chapter of Ranma... of
                                  course it was Vol 15, the Piccolet story, so
                                  that might explain some of that! ::laughing::

                                  schedule... mind if I ask what you'll be
                                  taking?

Kaori-Chan 8/16/01  10:39 PM probably a few classes I have not passed the
                                  last two times I've taken them, amongst some
                                  others...
                                  
                                  Japanese, Computer Science, maybe some
                                  philosophy or writing courses...

AV         8/16/01  10:41 PM Japanese? Sugoi! I'd love to take that... I
                                  found a self teaching site online and keep
                                  forgetting to visit it... Comp Sci will be of
                                  use too... I learned too much the hard way to
                                  do well in the class when I took it myself,
                                  though... I found it very frustrating, I hope
                                  you do better than I

AV         8/16/01  10:42 PM if you want to look at that Japanese Lang

Kaori-Chan 8/16/01  10:42 PM I should, I've been through the first semester
                                  twice.

AV         8/16/01  10:44 PM ::smiles and hugs you:: well, good luck... 
                                  
                                  you'll have to give me some idea when you'll
                                  be online so I don't end up missing you for
                                  weeks on end

Kaori-Chan 8/16/01  10:45 PM eh, I'm sure we'll figure out when a good time
                                  is....  The problem though is that I am almost
                                  never at home during college, I am off on
                                  campus talking with people I know or other
                                  things.  I am starved for social contact when
                                  not in college.

AV         8/16/01  10:46 PM I'll bet... well, there's always email, and I
                                  am sure you'll at least have access to that
                                  while you are on campus... how far away is the
                                  campus from your home?

Kaori-Chan 8/16/01  10:46 PM about 30 miles.

AV         8/16/01  10:47 PM do you drive or is there, like, a bus you have
                                  to wait for?

Kaori-Chan 8/16/01  10:48 PM O.o
                                  
                                  I'll likely be living on Campus.  The Dorms
                                  are right next to everything else, if they
                                  weren't, we'd all freeze walking to classes.

AV         8/16/01  10:48 PM O.o
                                  
                                  oh, ah... yeah... I guess so. Um, are you
                                  going to have online access from your dorm?

Kaori-Chan 8/16/01  10:49 PM of course, UAF has one of the United States
                                  Supercomputers... so the whole campus is
                                  ethernet.

AV         8/16/01  10:50 PM well, that's good... so, the campus is in
                                  Fairbanks, then, eh? I suppose that, in the
                                  event of a miracle ::innocent look:: I'll
                                  still be able to look you up!

Kaori-Chan 8/16/01  10:51 PM ^>^
                                  
                                  I'm pretty tired myself, so I understand where
                                  you're coming from.  I seem to have gotten on
                                  some semblance of a human schedule.

AV         8/16/01  10:52 PM ::hugs you:: it's a terrible cross to bear,
                                  but I think you'll be able to manage it
                                  ::smile::

Kaori-Chan 8/16/01  10:53 PM ha ha ha.  ::Snuggles next to you::

AV         8/16/01  10:54 PM ::sighs:: I think one of the reasons I get
                                  bummed out on icq is because I am a very
                                  tactile person... it really gets to me that I
                                  can't just *touch* you... ::rests her head on
                                  your chest:: I'm silly, I know...

Kaori-Chan 8/16/01  10:55 PM I try not to think of it... because it bothers
                                  me too.  It also makes me wonder if it'll ever
                                  happen...
                                  
                                  so I try not to think of it...

AV         8/16/01  10:56 PM yeah... me too... generates a lot of displaced
                                  frustration though, doesn't it? sorry for
                                  bringing it up... ::kisses you gently::

Kaori-Chan 8/16/01  10:58 PM It's alright... *Hugs*
                                  
                                  I have wanted to talk to you about my campaign
                                  setting... but I don't know if you're
                                  interested in it.  *Sighs*  I don't want to
                                  bore you or harass you about it if you are
                                  busy with other things though.
                                  
                                  You've been busy with your website and other
                                  stuff, so I haven't brought it up again.

AV         8/16/01  11:04 PM ::hugs back:: thanks for giving me some
                                  breathing room... my mind's been like a battle
                                  field at times, so there are times when I just
                                  can't cope with something new to think about,
                                  but I am interested... it is sort of
                                  frustrating to me because I am not familiar
                                  with the world, it's history and lore and
                                  legends, and yet... it tickles things in my
                                  subconscious... what you sent me was... very
                                  hard to fit into any context... 
                                  
                                  I haven't been able to think of a way to get
                                  more familiar with the material without making
                                  you go on and on about the history and
                                  legends... you've said you don't have much
                                  written down compared to what's in your
                                  head...
                                  
                                  you can bring it up... it might take me a
                                  while to have any useful input, but I am
                                  honestly interested, and would love to
                                  contribute if I can...

Kaori-Chan 8/16/01  11:06 PM perhaps tomorrow... tonight I am tired... is
                                  it already eleven? ::Sighs, wrapping his arms

                                  movie night, so that's why I haven't been
                                  on...

Kaori-Chan 8/17/01  9:58 PM  S'ok, I bought books, one you might really be
                                  interested in... it's a sci-fi story about a
                                  boy who is 20 and must decide on his gender,
                                  in a culture where they are able to switch
                                  back and forth until age 20.

AV         8/17/01  9:59 PM  really? give me the title and author and I'll
                                  go track it down... ::smiles::

                                  I think the title is "Commitment Hour"

AV         8/17/01  10:00 PM you wanna check it and make sure? ::wry
                                  smile:: and, mind if I ask where you found it?
                                  is it a new book or something you found in a

AV         8/17/01  10:04 PM darn, outta time... I'll talk to you about it

Kaori-Chan 8/17/01  10:05 PM it's a new book, I went to the bookstore and
                                  got it, I am sure about the author name, but
                                  the cover is confusing... and I went and
                                  checked it.  ^^;

                                  thinking of what it means to be a woman, or
                                  what it means to be a man... and the
                                  differences that are so inherant in the twin
                                  sides of the coin...
                                  
                                  can we truly accept shifting shape if we
                                  cannot understand both? If, in some strange
                                  way, we cannot consolidate the two, forge them
                                  together.... a twin bladed sword...

AV         8/18/01  1:12 AM  that's a good question... and one I've been
                                  concentrating on for a while now...
                                  
                                  ::hugs you:: I am back, hope I'm not too late
                                  ::smiles::

AV         8/18/01  1:33 AM  well... you went from away to unavailable, so
                                  I am assuming you've gone to bed... sweet
                                  dreams my love, I will talk to you tomorrow...

AV         8/19/01  12:43 AM Love smiles upon you

Kaori-Chan 8/19/01  1:08 AM  hey hon..

AV         8/19/01  1:26 AM  hi hi... was out stargazing for a moment...

Kaori-Chan 8/19/01  1:26 AM  *nods* Why the comment?  And why stargazing?

AV         8/19/01  1:29 AM  the comment, because I love you... and
                                  sometimes do a poor job of showing it.. I want
                                  you to know I love you and I don't want to
                                  make excuses for my behaviour... and I went
                                  out and stared up at the sky because I wanted
                                  to give you enough time to reply before going
                                  to bed... a bit of fresh air keeps me awake

Kaori-Chan 8/19/01  1:30 AM  *nods*
                                  
                                  I was watching Dracula 2000... I felt the
                                  ending wasn't all that surprising, like
                                  someone told me it was.
                                  
                                  Am a bit upset today, I'm in #DragonPhoenix if
                                  you want to talk there.

AV         8/19/01  1:30 AM  okay... see you there in a moment... I was
                                  just watching Event Horizon, and it was every
                                  bit as bad as I remember it... ::laughing;:

Kaori-Chan 8/19/01  1:31 AM  hey, I liked event horizon! Was creepy as all
                                  hell, particularly the ending.  ^^;

AV         8/19/01  1:33 AM  I liked it too... I wouldn't have watched it
                                  again if I didn't... but... well... ::shrugs:;

Kaori-Chan 8/19/01  9:22 PM  boo!

AV         8/19/01  9:22 PM  I was hoping you'd show up soon! ::smiles and
                                  hugs you tight::

Kaori-Chan 8/19/01  9:23 PM  ::Hugs you tight:: Bought Ephemeral Fantasia
                                  today... interesting game.

AV         8/19/01  9:23 PM  I went and got that book today... I'm a third
                                  of the way through it now...

AV         8/19/01  9:24 PM  I am on #DragonPhoenix if you want to join
                                  me... ::smiles::

Kaori-Chan 8/20/01  9:09 PM  *hugs* hey, sorry about last night.

AV         8/20/01  9:12 PM  ::smiles and hugs you back:: you're
                                  forgiven... I had to take a nap for a couple
                                  of hours to make up for a short and
                                  hyper-dream sleep, but I'm in a good mood now

AV         8/20/01  9:13 PM  I missed dinner, so I am gonna go scrounge up
                                  something to eat... then I'll be back to talk,
                                  okay?

Kaori-Chan 8/20/01  9:18 PM  okay, and roleplay?

AV         8/20/01  9:39 PM  I'm back...

Kaori-Chan 8/20/01  9:40 PM  hey.  ^>^

AV         8/20/01  9:40 PM  hey ::smiles::

Kaori-Chan 8/20/01  9:41 PM  what about Roleplaying hon?

AV         8/20/01  9:43 PM  I finished Commitment Hour today...  it gave
                                  me a lot to think about... 
                                  are you really desperate to play? if so, I
                                  need a few minutes to clear my head and get
                                  into the right frame of mind...

Kaori-Chan 8/20/01  9:43 PM  we could talk about Commitment hour for a
                                  couple minutes, if  you want.  I'm on IRC,
                                  RPing with roland right now.

AV         8/20/01  9:44 PM  ah... so, were you thinking of having me join
                                  you two for Master PC, or pick up what we
                                  started last night on the side of your other
                                  game?
                                  
                                  I'll log on to irc, we can talk in
                                  #DragonPhoenix about Commitment Hour

Kaori-Chan 8/20/01  9:45 PM  *nod nods*

AV         8/20/01  9:45 PM  okay, I'm in... talk to you there ::hugs::

Kaori-Chan 8/21/01  6:13 PM  hey...

AV         8/21/01  6:41 PM  hello... how long have you been waiting?

AV         8/21/01  6:46 PM  check it out!  http://www.forwriters.com/ 

Kaori-Chan 8/21/01  6:47 PM  Been back since 6:20

AV         8/21/01  6:47 PM  cool... I've been on and off doing writing
                                  research online... had to break to peel
                                  potatoes! yuck! ::laughing::

Kaori-Chan 8/21/01  6:48 PM  Alex... *Takes your hands* I am sorry about
                                  last night.

AV         8/21/01  6:50 PM  it wasn't all bad... you didn't get nasty til
                                  I had to go... ::smiles and pulls you close::
                                  sometimes I don't know what to do about that,
                                  but I know that it's the worst time to argue
                                  or make excuses... you just don't want me to
                                  go... I understand that

Kaori-Chan 8/21/01  6:52 PM  yes, but I've made a habit out of bad behavior
                                  lately.  =(

AV         8/21/01  6:54 PM  I know that when you are up to it, you will do
                                  something about it... and I'm not gonna
                                  lecture you or nag you about it... no point
                                  kicking a man just 'cuz he's tripped... if I
                                  can't take it, I'll just say goodnight and
                                  go... nothiing personal, just means I don't
                                  want to lose my temper with you ::hugs you::

                                  be good for publishing credit and such... a
                                  good start for unpublished authors... I'm
                                  gonna see if I have anything they'll take...

Kaori-Chan 8/21/01  6:57 PM  *Nods* I should write some short stories and

                                  magnum opus... except maybe to do a few serial
                                  shorts... and just concentrate on getting my
                                  stuff out there to be read...

Kaori-Chan 8/21/01  6:58 PM  I'm on IRC.... didn't close it since last

Kaori-Chan 8/22/01  8:00 PM  Would you like to talk to roland about what I
                                  want from RP's, Alex?  He's online right now.

AV         8/22/01  8:00 PM  er... in a little bit, sure

Kaori-Chan 8/22/01  8:07 PM  I talked to Roland, and he's willing to talk
                                  to you about it.  ^^;  I hope he doesn't come
                                  across as too awkward...

AV         8/22/01  8:08 PM  maybe... we'll see

Kaori-Chan 8/22/01  8:09 PM  he seems to be waiting to talk to you... ^^;

AV         8/22/01  8:19 PM  er... did you tell him?

Kaori-Chan 8/22/01  8:20 PM  yeah... what channel are you waiting on?

AV         8/22/01  8:20 PM  I was in Innocence, but I noticed his query
                                  just after I sent my last post

Kaori-Chan 8/22/01  8:21 PM  aaah.  Did you go back to that format you were
                                  using before? ^^;

AV         8/22/01  8:21 PM  no... but my email window was covering the end
                                  of the irc window

Kaori-Chan 8/22/01  8:22 PM  ah, gotcha.  *nod nods*

AV         8/22/01  8:22 PM  so... I'm on starchat if you want to talk

                                  things at times

Kaori-Chan 8/22/01  8:23 PM  ^>^ kay... 

AV         8/22/01  8:24 PM  good... 

Kaori-Chan 8/22/01  8:25 PM  I'm talking with Danita about... well, I'm
                                  telling her about parts of me she had no idea
                                  existed.

AV         8/23/01  12:41 AM ah... are you... distracted?

Kaori-Chan 8/23/01  2:58 AM  woah.

AV         8/23/01  2:58 AM  starchat is wigging out!

Kaori-Chan 8/23/01  2:59 AM  You need to go to options and turn on "REJOIN
                                  CHANNELS ON CONNECT"
                                  
                                  that will prevent the channels from closing
                                  when you get disconnected.
                                  
                                  Click on IRC but don't go to the sub-menu, it
                                  should be one of the check boxes.

AV         8/23/01  3:02 AM  done... took me a sec to find it

AV         8/25/01  12:40 AM hello... just firing up my computer... I have
                                  an errand to run, and then I'll be free to
                                  talk... so expect me to be about 15-20
                                  minutes... ::she hugs you and caresses your
                                  face::

AV         8/25/01  12:42 AM ::sighs:: one of the girls' birthday this
                                  week, we've been cleaning and moving furniture
                                  and decorating for a party tomorrow for the
                                  past two days... fortunately, I can dodge the
                                  party itself, I think, and hide in my room on
                                  the computer tomorrow... ::grins::

AV         8/25/01  12:43 AM ... or, Launce will take me out to the movies
                                  to pay me back for the extra work this week...
                                  ::shrugs:: dunno yet, but I'll let you know if
                                  something like that comes up ::smiles::

AV         8/25/01  12:44 AM anyway, gotta run for now... be back soon...
                                  ::kisses you::

Kaori-Chan 8/25/01  12:44 AM ::kisses back:: I'll be here.  ^>^

AV         8/25/01  12:45 AM great! see you soon! *mmmwwwwaaaaaaahhh!*

Kaori-Chan 8/25/01  2:35 AM  I'm not sure about you, but that seemed like 2
                                  hours.  ^>^

AV         8/25/01  2:35 AM  ;;drags her ass back in:: Yeah... thought we
                                  were just getting ice for the party
                                  tomorrow... more fool me...

AV         8/25/01  2:36 AM  amazing how you posted just as I sat back down
                                  at the computer... ::grinning::

Kaori-Chan 8/25/01  2:36 AM  heehee.

AV         8/25/01  2:36 AM  so, how'd you do it?

AV         8/25/01  2:37 AM  have I becom epredictibly unpredictable?

AV         8/25/01  2:38 AM  I hope you're not mad at me...

Kaori-Chan 8/25/01  2:39 AM  no, I'm not... if I was still 19, I might have
                                  been.  ^>^

AV         8/25/01  2:40 AM  well, that's good... ::takes your hand and
                                  kisses the palm::

Kaori-Chan 8/25/01  2:40 AM  *Giggles*
                                  
                                  You usually take longer than you thought you
                                  would.

AV         8/25/01  2:42 AM  yeah... I apparently can't make accurate
                                  predictions when other people are involved...
                                  ::shakes her head and leans against you::

Kaori-Chan 8/25/01  2:43 AM  it's been a while since we talked about...
                                  well, things other than dealing with your
                                  miracle or roleplaying.

AV         8/25/01  2:43 AM  what's on your mind?

Kaori-Chan 8/25/01  2:43 AM  several things, I'm on IRC if you want to talk
                                  there.

AV         8/25/01  2:43 AM  okay... be right there... ::kisses you::

AV         8/25/01  6:25 PM  I don't know if you got my other message... it
                                  didn't look like it was getting through...
                                  anyway, Launce is taking me out for coffee and
                                  a movie for helping out this week... I'll be
                                  out all evening, but I will check in with you
                                  when I get home... Take care, Love
                                  
                                  ::hugs you and gives you a kiss::

Kaori-Chan 8/25/01  6:36 PM  waah.  =\

AV         8/25/01  11:49 PM ::falls into your lap and curls up into a
                                  ball::

Kaori-Chan 8/25/01  11:49 PM I figured you were back when Launce logged on.

AV         8/25/01  11:49 PM ::nods::

Kaori-Chan 8/25/01  11:50 PM you tired already? ^>^

AV         8/25/01  11:50 PM ::nods, shakes her head... shrugs::

Kaori-Chan 8/25/01  11:50 PM uhm.  Okay.  ^^;

AV         8/25/01  11:51 PM ::takes a deep breath, lets it out and looks
                                  up at you::
                                  
                                  there's tired... and there's tired

AV         8/25/01  11:52 PM I'm awake enough, but... ::shrugs::

Kaori-Chan 8/25/01  11:52 PM I'm home along, can't call anyone, and most
                                  people I talk to aren't online.

AV         8/25/01  11:53 PM did you have a good day?

Kaori-Chan 8/25/01  11:53 PM not really, was a long day with n ot much to
                                  do.

AV         8/25/01  11:55 PM ah...
                                  
                                  we went to see American Pie 2... surprisingly,
                                  it was very good, a convincing next step, and
                                  the humor was not as contrived as I'd
                                  expected... got to sit down and eat, and
                                  stopped for a mocha frappichino... all in all,
                                  a nice evening, but there's something nagging
                                  at my mind tonight and it's wearying

Kaori-Chan 8/25/01  11:56 PM I'm on IRC... if you feel like talking there.

AV         8/25/01  11:57 PM it's disappointing sometimes to figure out how
                                  other people think... makes me wonder if
                                  there's hope for the species ::a dry chuckle::
                                  
                                  I'll join you there...

Kaori-Chan 8/26/01  3:33 AM  Hello? Are you there?

Kaori-Chan 8/26/01  3:35 AM  Alex?? yoohoo???

Kaori-Chan 8/26/01  5:39 AM  check your e-mail.

AV         8/26/01  7:06 PM  which account?

Kaori-Chan 8/26/01  9:57 PM  The one you first wrote to me with.  I was
                                  tired when I wrote, you can ignore it if you
                                  want.

AV         8/27/01  12:21 AM ah, well... that was my email account at that
                                  job, and it's long since dead...

Kaori-Chan 8/27/01  12:22 AM maybe you should check it, because I never
                                  received a bounce back reply.

AV         8/27/01  12:23 AM hmmm... I'd have to ask Launce if he can
                                  access it, but I never had remote access to
                                  that account...

Kaori-Chan 8/27/01  12:24 AM *shrugs* I apologize for last night, but it
                                  hurt my feelings that you somehow think my
                                  life is better because I have free time.
                                  
                                  Remember I have nobody to spend it with.  You
                                  have Launce and the girls.

AV         8/27/01  12:27 AM there were bruised feelings all around...
                                  still are as far as I can tell... 

AV         8/27/01  12:31 AM I accept your apology... but I wonder what it
                                  is exactly you're apologizing for?

Kaori-Chan 8/27/01  12:31 AM pardon?

AV         8/27/01  12:33 AM in your mind, how did you hurt me? you must
                                  sense that you *did* hurt me, otherwise you
                                  wouldn't apologize... so, I am just curious
                                  what you feel crossed the line and upset me
                                  enough to speak up

Kaori-Chan 8/27/01  12:33 AM Just leaving.

AV         8/27/01  12:34 AM no... that was just rude... I don't let things
                                  like that get to me...

AV         8/27/01  12:35 AM still, I happily accept your apology for doing
                                  that

Kaori-Chan 8/27/01  12:36 AM how can that not bother you? Me being rude?

AV         8/27/01  12:38 AM in my experience, people *not* being rude is
                                  the exception... given what I know about you,
                                  what you yourself admit, it's something I have
                                  to accept as a part of accepting you... I hope
                                  you refrain from being insufferably rude, but
                                  even there I'm willing to give you a little
                                  slack...

Kaori-Chan 8/27/01  12:38 AM am I really very rude?

AV         8/27/01  12:40 AM it wouldn't be very polite of me to really
                                  answer that... are you sure you want to invite
                                  that sort of "criticism"?

Kaori-Chan 8/27/01  12:41 AM I wouldn't have asked if I didn't.  

AV         8/27/01  12:46 AM it is not easy to say this... and there is a
                                  lot I won't say... I'll just answer the
                                  question stated, which is simply to say yes...
                                  you can really be very rude

AV         8/27/01  12:46 AM I won't insult you by trying to hypothesize
                                  "why"

Kaori-Chan 8/27/01  12:46 AM Does the severity of it bother you, since I'm
                                  unaware how severe you perceive me as?

AV         8/27/01  12:49 AM it concerns me, because it's not just a matter
                                  of you being rude to me... you are rude to a
                                  lot of people and only dimly aware of it at
                                  the time... I can hear some awareness of it,
                                  in general, when you talk about your
                                  relationships with people, or gripe about
                                  things that happened when talking to them...
                                  and, you always seem to blame them moreso than
                                  yourself for the outcome...

AV         8/27/01  12:51 AM now, don't get mad at me, you *did* ask...

Kaori-Chan 8/27/01  12:52 AM I'm not mad, I am thinking.  Do not give me
                                  less credit than usual simply because it's a
                                  sharp topic for a lot of people... remember,
                                  I'm the person who recognizes how selfish they
                                  can be a great deal of the time.  I can
                                  discuss things quite rationally when I am not
                                  tired.

Kaori-Chan 8/27/01  12:52 AM If anything, I should get mad for you fearing
                                  I should be mad, you should know me better
                                  than that...  but I won't because it's really
                                  not worth getting mad over.

AV         8/27/01  12:53 AM well, to my own ears it sounds harsh to say
                                  such things and text does not always convey a
                                  reasonable, or sympathetic tone of voice...

Kaori-Chan 8/27/01  12:54 AM You are worried about how I isolate myself
                                  with my callous behavior, I would wager?

AV         8/27/01  12:55 AM I hear you talking about feeling alone... of
                                  course I am concerned about how your own
                                  behaviour excerbates the situation... I don't
                                  want you to be unhappy

AV         8/27/01  12:56 AM when you want to be, you are unfailingly
                                  congenial and polite...

Kaori-Chan 8/27/01  12:56 AM I realize quite often how unfair I treat
                                  others, for instance, last night.  I probably
                                  wouldn't be satisfied even if you did humor me
                                  on my whims, and I realize that... I just have
                                  moments of relative insanity wherein I forget
                                  or cease to care about those factors.

AV         8/27/01  12:57 AM do you have any idea why?

AV         8/27/01  12:59 AM you're not the only one, you know... it
                                  happens to me, too... and I try very hard to
                                  keep it from causing disasters, but I can't
                                  prevent it from causing more than enough
                                  trouble...

Kaori-Chan 8/27/01  1:00 AM  *Laughs* Exactly.  It causes just enough hurt
                                  and pain to others to eventually consider
                                  dropping you, or some such... is that correct?

AV         8/27/01  1:00 AM  more or less...

AV         8/27/01  1:01 AM  as best as I can tell it's some form of
                                  automatic self preservation reflex I developed
                                  to survive my family

Kaori-Chan 8/27/01  1:01 AM  I am not sure why it happens.  Usually there
                                  is a rational reason behind it that gets
                                  immensely overblown... such as you and your
                                  schedule.  It does bother me that you don't
                                  get on till midnight, I can't stay up nights
                                  all the time... summer is an exception.

Kaori-Chan 8/27/01  1:02 AM  In a way, my selfishness also extends to our
                                  relationship, I want you to spend all your
                                  time with me... perhaps because misery loves
                                  company and when I can't do anything you are
                                  always off doing SOMETHING... it is usually a
                                  layer thing which influences my explosions
                                  like that.

AV         8/27/01  1:03 AM  well, don't go imagining that I'm off having
                                  fun while you're stewing in misery and
                                  isolation... that is *so* not true

Kaori-Chan 8/27/01  1:05 AM  but at least you are provided distractions,
                                  that is all I am saying.  I go to movies and
                                  stuff too, but more often than not, it's with
                                  my parents.  It is nice to go with the family
                                  sometimes, but I often feel the ache of
                                  wanting to go see things with friends,
                                  especially after a spending a semester around
                                  other people.

AV         8/27/01  1:10 AM  yes, but do you think these are *welcome*
                                  distractions? there is so much I must do, that
                                  I am forced to set aside, shove to the back of
                                  my mind, to deal with people who all make high
                                  demands on my time and attention... and I'm
                                  not talking primarily about you. the girls,
                                  well all children really, demand all the
                                  attention they can get, Launce's father is not
                                  much better... I don't care to criticize him,
                                  but in his own way, Launce is largely geared
                                  around finding ways to amuse himself, and to
                                  that extent I am one of the means at his
                                  disposal... 

AV         8/27/01  1:12 AM  there are days when I would almost kill to
                                  have nothing to do but sit around alone and
                                  undisturbed all day

AV         8/27/01  1:12 AM  I might just be able to clear my head and get
                                  something done for once... ::laughs::

Kaori-Chan 8/27/01  1:14 AM  so disappear, just go off by yourself to
                                  somewhere where nobody would find you and just
                                  sit for a day.

AV         8/27/01  1:18 AM  I was just making a point... if it were really
                                  that simple I would have resolved my problems
                                  a long time ago

Kaori-Chan 8/27/01  1:19 AM  If you think  it isn't simple to just walk out
                                  and abandon everything for twenty four hours,
                                  it's not.
                                  
                                  If you mean it isn't that simple for fixing
                                  your problem, I can't comment.

AV         8/27/01  1:20 AM  fair enough

Kaori-Chan 8/27/01  1:21 AM  if it's the first one, the only thing keeping
                                  you from doing it is what other people want
                                  and demand from you.

AV         8/27/01  1:22 AM  I've done the first a thousand times... it's
                                  only scary the first couple of times, and only
                                  hard when your resources are constrained....

Kaori-Chan 8/27/01  1:22 AM  have you done it recently?

AV         8/27/01  1:23 AM  yes

Kaori-Chan 8/27/01  1:23 AM  just making sure.  I hope you realize I didn't
                                  assume that you had it better, I just knew you
                                  are always doing things and I am always at
                                  home.

AV         8/27/01  1:26 AM  I did not assume anything... I sensed you did
                                  not really understand the constraints I have
                                  to work with, or else you could not accept or
                                  forgive those limitations

Kaori-Chan 8/27/01  1:28 AM  I am concerned with the positions you've put
                                  yourself into, as I tried to explain once. 
                                  You seem to be always in a position that would
                                  dictate such problems be prevalent and
                                  constant.

AV         8/27/01  1:28 AM  maybe that's true, but are you seriously
                                  blaming me for that?

Kaori-Chan 8/27/01  1:29 AM  I should not, I understand that.  At times I
                                  do... like I said, those moments of temporary
                                  insanity.
                                  
                                  I don't blame you, but the situation makes me
                                  angry because A) I can do nothing about it. 
                                  B) You put yourself in the situation.  C) I
                                  have no solution for it... so understandably
                                  it becomes a frustration, when it's about a
                                  person I love and care for deeply.

AV         8/27/01  1:35 AM  I can't afford to believe that A, B or C are
                                  necessarilly true... there is more to be said
                                  on all three points, both for me and for
                                  you... if you start out thinking that way, you
                                  give yourself no option of proving
                                  otherwise...

Kaori-Chan 8/27/01  1:36 AM  I cannot make choices for you, Alex.  In that
                                  respect, both A) and C) are true....

AV         8/27/01  1:41 AM  am I to understand that, to you, the situation
                                  is something to be resolved merely by making a
                                  choice?

Kaori-Chan 8/27/01  1:45 AM  No.  I am only saying I can't make decisions
                                  for you, I cannot give you solutions to your
                                  problems.  I cannot fix those problems unless
                                  you want them fixed.
                                  
                                  I'm not sure if you will read that and
                                  understand what I mean, or if you will read it
                                  and understand what you perceive it to mean.

AV         8/27/01  1:47 AM  I need to think about it for a bit... be back
                                  in a bit...

AV         8/27/01  4:38 AM  what got you onto this?

Kaori-Chan 8/27/01  4:39 AM  I check some sights regularly... My interest
                                  in ET stuff is because I like science fiction
                                  and things such as this.
                                  
                                  This... blows my mind.

                                  that could be easily hoaxed.  You'd need
                                  someone familiar with chemical composition for
                                  the DNA structures (Because there is one major

                                  believe something others think is impossible

                                  "incredibly important" things in my time that
                                  I don't get excited about them... a thing of
                                  value has obvious worth... if others have

                                  I just had a long talk with Launce... he's
                                  been at me to stop "obsessing" over "changing"
                                  things and just accept that things are the way
                                  they are for a reason, and "don't fool
                                  yourself with the notion that you have a clue

Kaori-Chan 8/27/01  5:14 AM  You're the least misguided person I know... he
                                  doesn't know what he's talking about.  I
                                  believe in you.
                                  
                                  I believe.

AV         8/27/01  5:15 AM  that's more than I ever asked for... thank you

Kaori-Chan 8/27/01  5:16 AM  I cannot do anything else, Alex, I'm in love
                                  with you.  You are forever a part of me.

AV         8/27/01  5:20 AM  I can't think straight... I need to go to

Kaori-Chan 8/27/01  5:21 AM  *Nods* Go to sleep, Alex... I love you so very
                                  very much... *Holds you tightly, kissing you*
                                  Please never stop believing.

AV         8/27/01  5:30 AM  I hardly dare to speak... but listen hard
                                  enough and you will know all that needs to be

                                  so I will say goodnight, and trust in you, as

                                  I am the one who coupled with doubt... and
                                  doubt has been an unkind lover to me... so,
                                  perhaps it *is* difficult to let go of doubt,
                                  but without doubt I am my own person

Kaori-Chan 8/28/01  12:14 AM Alex...?

AV         8/28/01  2:08 AM  I'm sorry that took so long...

Kaori-Chan 8/28/01  2:09 AM  how are you doing hon?

AV         8/28/01  2:11 AM  a bit kerflummixed...

Kaori-Chan 8/28/01  2:12 AM  not sure if that is a word... =(  I hope you
                                  have not lost your faith in yourself.

AV         8/28/01  2:15 AM  it's never wrong to question yourself... but
                                  in this case what I am questioning is the
                                  significance and relevance of the situation I
                                  am faced with... things happen for a reason,
                                  and I am wondering what purpose is served
                                  by... grrr, how do I put it?

Kaori-Chan 8/28/01  2:16 AM  please don't tell me you are giving up, Alex. 
                                  =(

AV         8/28/01  2:17 AM  you need not worry about that... there is no
                                  *need* for me to give up...

Kaori-Chan 8/28/01  2:18 AM  That makes me happy.

AV         8/28/01  2:18 AM  I should try to fill you in on what's been
                                  going on, but you have to look beyond the
                                  surface of what I say, because, frankly, I
                                  don't seem to be very good at hitting the mark
                                  with words lately...

AV         8/28/01  2:20 AM  or maybe I am only saying that because I don't
                                  really know how to describe what's been
                                  happening...

Kaori-Chan 8/28/01  2:20 AM  I just want to make sure that Launce didn't
                                  convince you that you've been a moron all your
                                  life.

AV         8/28/01  2:33 AM  hmmm... I don't really blame him for insisting
                                  that the human brain is simply incapible of
                                  grasping the things I claim to grasp, nor am I
                                  surprised at the arguments which follow that
                                  assumption... I know what the point he's
                                  really trying to make is... 

AV         8/28/01  2:33 AM  it's difficult to paraphrase, but what he's
                                  been saying is to wake up, stop dreaming, and
                                  rid myself of foolish wishful thinking and pay
                                  attention to where I am... accept what is,
                                  learn to cope with it, and make the best of
                                  it... to stop kidding myself and start acting
                                  rationally
                                  

AV         8/28/01  2:33 AM  on the whole, it's not bad advice... once
                                  you've dismissed the notion that you are
                                  responsible for you own existence... 

Kaori-Chan 8/28/01  2:34 AM  *Is quiet, listening to the woman he loves
                                  patiently*

AV         8/28/01  2:37 AM  I'll give him this, Launce really is a
                                  champion debater... he listens to everything
                                  you say, grasps the heuristic logic and
                                  structure, then finds ways to use your own
                                  "arguements" to dismiss your assertions, belay
                                  the validity of the points you make, and
                                  "prove" that by your own logic you agree with
                                  his principle assertion

Kaori-Chan 8/28/01  2:39 AM  He sounds like a very frustrating individual,
                                  not to mention... incredibly full of himself.

AV         8/28/01  2:43 AM  no... it's easy to mistake confidence for
                                  arrogance... when a person can do exactly what
                                  he claims, that's not arrogance... it's easy
                                  for some people to hate Launce because they
                                  just can't believe he's accomplished as much
                                  as he has... the man is frighteningly
                                  intelligent, but admits freely to his own
                                  limitations... 

Kaori-Chan 8/28/01  2:43 AM  Being full of yourself does not omit
                                  intelligence, nor does it omit cruelty.

AV         8/28/01  2:45 AM  that's an interesting criticism coming from a
                                  self avowed elitist, though

Kaori-Chan 8/28/01  2:47 AM  I am not sure what to say about that.  You
                                  have more to say on the subject I am sure, and
                                  what you thought out/are feeling.

AV         8/28/01  2:48 AM  you'll have to forgive me... I don't label
                                  people, and I don't condone the labeling of
                                  people... labels distort perception... I know
                                  you don't like him... I don't expect you to
                                  think he deserves respect... but in my
                                  experience he does... you'll never know him
                                  the way I do, and I don't see a time when you
                                  will

Kaori-Chan 8/28/01  2:49 AM  Do not mistake my dislike for disrespect or
                                  not knowing him, you were right about some
                                  things... we are both very alike.
                                  
                                  You failed to notice, however, that we are
                                  also diametric opposites in some fashion.

AV         8/28/01  2:50 AM  how so?

AV         8/28/01  2:54 AM  ::waiting patiently for your answer::

Kaori-Chan 8/28/01  2:54 AM  dammit.... *Kicks ICQ*

AV         8/28/01  2:55 AM  yeah... it's limiting message size... annoying

AV         8/28/01  2:55 AM  I've been copying long posts to a notepad and
                                  splicing them back in in shorter sections...

Kaori-Chan 8/28/01  2:56 AM  no, it isn't that, it's that I told it to AUTO
                                  SEND LATER because it wouldn't allow me to
                                  send, and now the message is completely lost.
                                  
                                  Launce is incredibly intelligent, and that is
                                  a serious threat, because although he is
                                  intelligent, he is also ignorant of things you
                                  and I have discussed.  He denies their
                                  existence.  That is so incredibly inadequate
                                  compared to what I previously wrote.

AV         8/28/01  2:57 AM  um... when do those get sent? when you
                                  disconnect?

AV         8/28/01  2:57 AM  oh... email... let me check...

Kaori-Chan 8/28/01  2:57 AM  Launce and I are both very intelligent, he
                                  uses his intelligence to prove his own
                                  authority and submit others to it.  With that,
                                  he has power, power is to be respected and
                                  feared.
                                  
                                  I used to do very much the same.  I am trying
                                  to escape from it.

Kaori-Chan 8/28/01  2:59 AM  I do not discount Launce's intelligence
                                  either, BECAUSE he is intelligent, it is more
                                  of a reason to dislike him... particularly for
                                  the purposes he has used his intelligence.
                                  
                                  And when I speak of intelligence, I speak only
                                  that Launce is expert at numerous things.

Kaori-Chan 8/28/01  2:59 AM  I had a conversation with him where he
                                  completely was ignorant of what I had to say,
                                  not that he did not hear it, but that he did
                                  not HEAR it.  He chose to perceive it in his
                                  own reality, and not the reality that I
                                  represent and believe in.

Kaori-Chan 8/28/01  3:00 AM  In a way, Launce has solidified.  THAT is a
                                  bad thing.  He has become solid in his state
                                  in the world, he has become as Launce as he
                                  will ever be.

AV         8/28/01  3:06 AM  I can't comment on that... for one thing, I
                                  don't need to defend Launce... nor do I have
                                  the right to confide to you things he's shared
                                  with me in confidence... there is a great deal
                                  you don't know about him, and... frankly, I
                                  don't think you really care... now that
                                  animosity has set in, you've guaranteed that
                                  you will never know the real story on
                                  Launce... so, better to set that aside

Kaori-Chan 8/28/01  3:09 AM  *shakes his head* Alex, you honestly
                                  misunderstand me.  Launce is not important
                                  enough for me to care about him, because he
                                  proved to me who he is and is not.
                                  
                                  I respect him because he is ruthless in his
                                  persuit of success, that truly is something. 
                                  He is a powerful individual, however, I knew
                                  the point would come when he himself
                                  confronted you and told you exactly what you
                                  have told me.
                                  
                                  

Kaori-Chan 8/28/01  3:09 AM  But all people must make their own mistakes
                                  and reparations, it is not my  place to impose
                                  my instinctual knowledge on others.  I tried
                                  that, and was believed a liar.

AV         8/28/01  3:13 AM  ::shakes her head:: you don't know who and
                                  what he really is... what makes him
                                  important... nor do you know the specifics of
                                  what we have discussed... the first three
                                  points I am not at liberty to discuss, but the
                                  last I can and will if you desire... 

Kaori-Chan 8/28/01  3:13 AM  I realize so very much that he is human, that
                                  he has made mistakes.... that he regrets
                                  things in his life.  I know that about all
                                  people, Alex, I am painfully aware of it every
                                  moment of my existence.  It is the only thing
                                  driving me, the fact that I am just as human
                                  and fallable.  I forgive him his
                                  eccentricities and the arguments we've had.
                                  
                                  So he is unimportant to me. 
                                  
                                  

Kaori-Chan 8/28/01  3:13 AM  However, he is important to you, or you would
                                  not have let him disturb you so.  In that
                                  respect, the situation is important to me.
                                  
                                  Launce is neither a dupe nor a genius, but i
                                  do know he is a dangerous man.  A very
                                  dangerous man.
                                  
                                  A better translation of what I mean is he is
                                  one to be respected, never ignored, and he
                                  chooses his words quite carefully in a
                                  calculated manner.  
                                  

Kaori-Chan 8/28/01  3:15 AM  The world is meaningless beside you, so is
                                  Launce.
                                  
                                  I am interested in how the past few days have
                                  effected you, since your discussion with him. 
                                  After that, I would hear the important things
                                  you discussed with him, and any enlightenment
                                  you could provide on his Personality.
                                  
                                  

AV         8/28/01  3:21 AM  that's a tall bill of order... let me start
                                  with how the last few days have effected me,
                                  and add that I've been having such discussions
                                  with him for several years... first, when
                                  Launce first met me, he too initially thought
                                  that I was the Keeper...

AV         8/28/01  3:26 AM  as it happens, Launce is a certified genius...
                                  he generally regards me as a peer level
                                  intellect, and often admits that he's out of
                                  his depth with me in discussion of the greater
                                  truth... we both know that I am not as
                                  knowledgeable, I never wasted much of my
                                  resources on conventional knowledge, but my
                                  level of comprehension often exceeds his...

Kaori-Chan 8/28/01  3:27 AM  I am sure if we could get past the blocks we
                                  both seem to have developed, I would astonish
                                  him as well.  Do you think so, or am I giving
                                  myself too much credit?

AV         8/28/01  3:30 AM  don't be discouraged, you do have a ways to
                                  go, but it's more in the realm of personality
                                  and socialization... as well as the
                                  cultivation of a comprehensive standard... I
                                  don't doubt that you could earn his respect
                                  and even his friendship if you... well...
                                  matured a bit.... his criticisms of you have
                                  been no different than your criticisms of
                                  yourself

Kaori-Chan 8/28/01  3:31 AM  the first time, I ended the discussion with
                                  him.  The second time, he ended it with me.

AV         8/28/01  3:34 AM  he was just making a point... 

Kaori-Chan 8/28/01  3:34 AM  heh.  I interrupted you, I apologize.

AV         8/28/01  3:36 AM  if you want to resolve the situation between
                                  you and Launce, I am all for it... it would
                                  put you in a better position to understand
                                  that Launce is not the boogie man... or at
                                  least not when his job does not call for it,
                                  and I assure you it does not call for it in my
                                  situation... 

Kaori-Chan 8/28/01  3:37 AM  *Shrugs* I'll likely talk to him again.
                                  
                                  Do you have anything to say to convince me he
                                  is not absolutely wrong and malicious for
                                  telling you to "Stop fantasizing"?

AV         8/28/01  3:40 AM  he's not as hide bound as you might expect...
                                  he believes in much the same things I do...
                                  he's not trying to tell me that I am utterly
                                  and completely wrong... he admits that he
                                  doesn't understand things at the level I do,
                                  but he's seen enough to show him that the
                                  world, reality and existence is much as I've
                                  described... 

Kaori-Chan 8/28/01  3:41 AM  alright.

AV         8/28/01  3:43 AM  you remember the matrix model of reality I
                                  proposed? where souls accept certain
                                  limitations to participate in the construct,
                                  and that each life is engineered with lessons,
                                  or paths of development? 

Kaori-Chan 8/28/01  3:43 AM  *Nods* I do.

AV         8/28/01  3:46 AM  okay, that's about the way he perceives
                                  reality... the laws and limits of reality are
                                  only true within the construct, but, since
                                  participation is voluntary, we are obliged to
                                  obey those rules... for one thing, if too many
                                  of the laws are broken, the construct itself
                                  is threatened... it could unravel under the
                                  wrong kind of pressure

Kaori-Chan 8/28/01  3:48 AM  *Listens*

AV         8/28/01  3:49 AM  the point that he's been making is that the
                                  laws of the construct do not allow for people
                                  using their full potential, it's not geared to
                                  accommodate "godlike" participants... he feels
                                  that my pursuit runs contrary to the purpose
                                  of life in the construct... he feels that I am
                                  overlooking my true "mission" in life by
                                  striving to reach my full potential

Kaori-Chan 8/28/01  3:49 AM  Hehehehe.  He has not even considered that
                                  this may BE your mission for humanity as well
                                  as yourself?

AV         8/28/01  3:51 AM  he is not sure, he is not saying that I am
                                  wrong, just that it seems to be a conflict... 

Kaori-Chan 8/28/01  3:51 AM  I see it in this manner: Mankind is dying.

AV         8/28/01  3:53 AM  to his way of thinking, my objective is
                                  inappropriate to living in the matrix...
                                  starting from that point he has been
                                  questioning my assertions... as for mankind
                                  dying, it's more a case of a massive influx of
                                  new souls, souls that haven't the experience
                                  or the maturity to play well together... half
                                  the people who have lived on Earth since the
                                  beginning are alive right now
                                  
                                  The Game... so to speak... is experiencing a
                                  swell of popularity... 

AV         8/28/01  3:54 AM  more people are "playing" now then ever before
                                  in history...

Kaori-Chan 8/28/01  3:55 AM  Alex.  Humanity is dying in it's own vomit...
                                  my view is that, if there is a Creator, then
                                  there will be those sent to guide those who
                                  are lost.  If there is not, then there is no
                                  hope for anyone.

AV         8/28/01  3:56 AM  every generation has succumbed to the feeling
                                  that "the end of the world is neigh"... the
                                  truth is, the symptoms of disaster we see are
                                  part of nature restoring the balance... and,
                                  given the true nature of souls, there really
                                  isn't a God... or as Launce puts it, "There is
                                  no Justice there is Just Us..."

Kaori-Chan 8/28/01  3:58 AM  You know why I disagree with that statement. 
                                  I was the embodiment of the sword of god in a
                                  previous life.

AV         8/28/01  4:00 AM  even if it is true, you have to be able to
                                  question it... to me, that is a surface
                                  statement, if you look below the surface, what
                                  does it really mean? Who is God? Why does He
                                  need an embodiment of His Sword?  Don't take
                                  this the wrong way, but if a belief is true,
                                  or rather if what you believe in is true, then
                                  it has substance...

Kaori-Chan 8/28/01  4:01 AM  Misconception.  That is the way people think
                                  nowadays, if they don't have proof it must not
                                  exist.

AV         8/28/01  4:03 AM  the reason I put if forward is... God has to
                                  know the answer to the question... I am not
                                  looking for proof, I am simply looking for
                                  thought... in most religions faith is used to
                                  discourage thought... don't ask questions,
                                  just believe me...

Kaori-Chan 8/28/01  4:04 AM  I don't care if nobody believes me, that is a
                                  nicety.  I simply know what I have felt was
                                  true since I was a small boy.
                                  
                                  As you do.  

AV         8/28/01  4:05 AM  there is a big difference between doubting
                                  yourself and questioning yourself... and while
                                  I don't doubt my self, I always question
                                  myself... you may understand something
                                  perfectly and yet fail to comprehend it...

AV         8/28/01  4:06 AM  it's the difference between having something
                                  and knowing how to use it...

Kaori-Chan 8/28/01  4:06 AM  what is your opinion, in response to what
                                  Launce says? Are you breaking rules?

AV         8/28/01  4:08 AM  now that is magnificently to the point... and
                                  the answer is, to the best of my
                                  understanding, no... however, there are
                                  questions that are very difficult to answer
                                  which make it difficult to say that to the
                                  best of my comprehension

Kaori-Chan 8/28/01  4:09 AM  Which questions?

AV         8/28/01  4:11 AM  ergh... I need a break to go into that...

Kaori-Chan 8/28/01  4:11 AM  alright.

AV         8/28/01  4:11 AM  you see, I still don't quite understand
                                  Launce's point... that makes it hard to figure
                                  out if the point applies to me

AV         8/28/01  4:12 AM  so, let me stretch my legs and see if I can
                                  pin it down... and, that is essentially what's
                                  been "bothering" me of late...

Kaori-Chan 8/28/01  4:12 AM  Remember that Launce is human, just as I am. 
                                  Sometimes humans think their points are
                                  relevant when they are meaningless.

AV         8/28/01  4:13 AM  Launce is... not exactly human, Mark... that's
                                  what I've been trying to get you to
                                  understand... 

Kaori-Chan 8/28/01  4:14 AM  Alright, then what is he?  Or, I get the
                                  impression more appropriately, WHO is he?

AV         8/28/01  4:25 AM  ::thinks carefully about what she can say::
                                  
                                  Launce is, in his own way, as much an
                                  exception in this world as I am... from what
                                  I've said about the matrix, you might have the
                                  idea that people go from life to life walking
                                  different paths, growing and evolving over
                                  generations... Since the beginning, Launce has
                                  walked the same path... or rather, performed a
                                  function... a protective function

AV         8/28/01  4:28 AM  there are always others doing the same job,
                                  each taking a turn on the wheel, and some have
                                  done it more than once... but he has always
                                  done it

AV         8/28/01  4:29 AM  and yes, I was skeptical at first... I am a
                                  very accepting person, but I don't take things
                                  at face value...

AV         8/28/01  4:30 AM  you see... I'd met his kind before... and I
                                  knew that his kind existed before I met any of
                                  them... just as there are other kinds, people
                                  who hold different, but equally important
                                  jobs, and I've met some of them

AV         8/28/01  4:32 AM  because fo the nature of his job, he's had
                                  need to draw on experience from his other
                                  lives, and through the open door of memory
                                  he's pulled other things through...

AV         8/28/01  4:33 AM  um... let's just say that if he comes knocking
                                  on your door, you've probably done something
                                  to bring him there...

Kaori-Chan 8/28/01  4:34 AM  I am asking Allen to grant me an outside point
                                  of view... what you are saying is entirely
                                  possible, and might indeed be the case.  As it
                                  stands, I know very little if nothing about
                                  Launce the individual.
                                  
                                  

Kaori-Chan 8/28/01  4:34 AM  I also realize you have known him a very long
                                  time, and that he's an important friend to
                                  you, so I ask that you consider my words
                                  without discounting what I am saying as the
                                  emotions of someone who simply has a
                                  disagreement.  I removed my emotions from what
                                  you were telling me and closed my eyes,
                                  thinking of it for a deep, long moment...
                                  
                                  All that I can say is... I have a bad feeling.

AV         8/28/01  4:35 AM  go on...

Kaori-Chan 8/28/01  4:36 AM  I cannot define it, and I have no excuse for
                                  it.  I think I may have always had it, even
                                  before meeting Launce... a sense of
                                  foreboading as you asked for me to meet your
                                  friends, which is an incredibly strange thing
                                  to have since I am generally a very open
                                  person.  I add people to my ICQ list all the
                                  time, sometimes at request.
                                  

Kaori-Chan 8/28/01  4:36 AM  *Shakes his head* I can't substantiate it, and
                                  you have every reason to decline considering
                                  that factor, you have known him longer.  All
                                  that I have is a feeling.

Kaori-Chan 8/28/01  4:38 AM  It could be anything... it could be from a
                                  simple personality flaw that my inner self
                                  senses before it becomes apparent (Sixth
                                  sense), to a horrible and life-damaging
                                  mistake he will make through a choice or
                                  active decision.

AV         8/28/01  4:38 AM  who, Launce?

Kaori-Chan 8/28/01  4:40 AM  Something related to him or he himself.

AV         8/28/01  4:41 AM  fear existes to inform you of what you dare
                                  not take for granted... I don't take him for
                                  granted

AV         8/28/01  4:41 AM  as much as possible, I don't take anyone for
                                  granted...

Kaori-Chan 8/28/01  4:41 AM  *laughs* This is not fear.

AV         8/28/01  4:42 AM  forboding? do we need to split hairs?

Kaori-Chan 8/28/01  4:43 AM  Even forboding is inadequate.  It isn't so
                                  much an emotion as a sensation.
                                  
                                  it isn't a feeling, it's something both more
                                  and less tangible.  I've gotten impressions of
                                  horrendous mistakes couples make when they
                                  pursue eachother, amongs other things.
                                  
                                  But, it is your right to discount it as fear. 
                                  You know him best.

AV         8/28/01  4:45 AM  ::sigh:: never mind, you completely missed my
                                  point... 

Kaori-Chan 8/28/01  4:46 AM  No, I did not.  You were saying perhaps I am
                                  simply being told Launce is one not to be
                                  taken for granted.  Or was I incorrect?

AV         8/28/01  4:49 AM  I was not dismissing what you were saying, nor
                                  discounting its significance... it was a
                                  comment on the fact that the nature and
                                  purpose of perception are often misunderstood,
                                  and in such cases change an asset into a
                                  deficit... and my point was, I recognize
                                  significance and pay heed to it
                                  
                                  and much more is implied in saying it as I did

Kaori-Chan 8/28/01  4:50 AM  aaah, when you say it in that manner, it
                                  changes entirely what you mean though.
                                  
                                  When saying you value significance and such.

AV         8/28/01  4:51 AM  when words are almost certain to fail you, say
                                  more by speaking less

AV         8/28/01  4:52 AM  some things are dangerous only because you
                                  fail to recognize their nature, and account
                                  for it in you actions regarding it

Kaori-Chan 8/28/01  4:53 AM  Regardless, perhaps I am wrong.

AV         8/28/01  4:56 AM  I am not saying you are, just pointing out
                                  that the possability of danger is not a
                                  promise of danger... but I should add, in life
                                  there are some dangers you cannot avoid... 

AV         8/28/01  5:01 AM  I have to admit, I am rather cautious in
                                  dealing with Launce... he is the first to
                                  admit that he doesn't care to look at the big
                                  picture, and that it sort of boggles his mind
                                  that there would be any need for anyone in the
                                  matrix to see the big picture... it strikes
                                  him as an abberation

AV         8/28/01  5:04 AM  it's hard for him to see that there is a
                                  legitimate purpose for someone like me to be
                                  here to do what I have always known I am here
                                  to do... thus, such a conviction is either
                                  alarming or absurd to consider... he admits
                                  that I do not register as a threat... and that
                                  reinforces his belief that I am being
                                  foolishly ambitious and self deluded

AV         8/28/01  5:04 AM  and I understand his reasoning... I often
                                  wonder if the world is really ready for
                                  someone like me to come fully online... then
                                  again, I've seen lots of reasons why a bigger
                                  gun might need to be brought to bear

AV         8/28/01  5:07 AM  I don't really try to convince him that I am
                                  right, or that my existence is justified... it
                                  doesn't hurt me to listen to his take on
                                  things... especially since my path has brought
                                  me to this quite exclusively... there is
                                  guidance in life, there is a natural flow...
                                  if you fight it, bad things happen... if you
                                  heed it, you grow and learn...

Kaori-Chan 8/28/01  5:07 AM  ?????

AV         8/28/01  5:08 AM  I am not here, living in his house, listening
                                  to his concerns and advice by accident

AV         8/28/01  5:09 AM  think of it this way, in the past few years,
                                  the only way I could really have strayed off
                                  the path would have been to jump off the side
                                  of the cliff it's climbing

AV         8/28/01  5:10 AM  to have my conviction, my faith in myself,
                                  tested every step of the way does not strike
                                  me as out of place... not with the path I am
                                  walking

AV         8/28/01  5:11 AM  to come across one of the most formidible
                                  people alive in the world today, at this
                                  juncture, does not surprise me either...

AV         8/28/01  5:12 AM  you want to know what the question's I've
                                  faced really boil down to?

Kaori-Chan 8/28/01  5:12 AM  Alex? Are you there?

AV         8/28/01  5:12 AM  yes... 

AV         8/28/01  5:12 AM  have you gotten any of what I've been saying?

AV         8/28/01  5:14 AM  Mark?

Kaori-Chan 8/28/01  5:16 AM  Alex, I need to go to bed...

AV         8/28/01  5:17 AM  did you get anything I've sent to you? I am on
                                  irc! say yes if you read me

Kaori-Chan 8/28/01  5:21 AM  Oh well, I am sure you're either asleep on the
                                  keyboard or off spending time thinking...  If
                                  you wish, write me an e-mail explaining what
                                  you were trying to get across but I kept
                                  interrupting.
                                  
                                  *Kisses*
                                  
                                  Goodnight.

AV         8/28/01  5:21 AM  damn it... 

Kaori-Chan 8/28/01  5:22 AM  are you still there? I am going to bed now...
                                  =\

AV         8/28/01  5:22 AM  check your friggin email!!!

Kaori-Chan 8/28/01  7:27 PM  I value dreams, aspirations, I value the
                                  impossible and the seemingly childish.  I
                                  value the magick and the magnanimous mystery
                                  of striving to perform things logically
                                  inconceivable.  I am a dreamer, Launce is a
                                  realist.
                                  
                                  I can fathom his perspectives, but he is too
                                  stuck on the material that the world is
                                  seemingly fashioned out of (Drivel, as I like
                                  to refer to it), and is quite dense in
                                  respects to matters which you and I have
                                  talked of.
                                  
                                  He is very intelligent, otherwise he would not
                                  get me so angry... that intelligence is a
                                  danger and a threat, in a fashion, because he
                                  denies what is outside his experience to
                                  exist.

AV         8/28/01  7:40 PM  he's not as much a materialist as he is a
                                  pragmatist... don't make to firm an opinion
                                  until you've reached the point where you on
                                  good enough speaking terms to hear his
                                  thoughts from his own mouth... if there's
                                  anything here that really bothers me is that
                                  you form such a strong opinion of the man and
                                  you barely even know him... I assume you're
                                  just giving me your impressions of him, but
                                  the way you put things...

AV         8/28/01  7:41 PM  well, you can't possible be speaking from
                                  authority, you have not had enough exposure to
                                  make an informed opinion

AV         8/28/01  7:43 PM  honestly, there is no reason to go into the
                                  subject of Launce in such detail anyway... nor
                                  to debate it... I am not Launce's public
                                  defender, I don't really have the right to try
                                  and explain him, or judge him... I can hardly
                                  claim to know him all that well, we've only
                                  been friends for a few years

AV         8/28/01  7:44 PM  maybe I'm the fool for getting into it so
                                  deep... or maybe you just hit a nerve with
                                  me... I don't know

AV         8/28/01  7:45 PM  I suppose it just bothers me when people don't
                                  get along... from where I stand, there is no
                                  need for anger or resentment or competition...
                                  Launce is Launce... you're you... I don't
                                  expect you two to be on the same page

AV         8/28/01  7:46 PM  well, I suppose at this point I should be
                                  wondering if anything I am saying is getting
                                  to you at all, after last night it's like
                                  everything I say in icq just vanishes into a
                                  black hole... did you get my emails from last
                                  night?

AV         8/28/01  7:48 PM  well, I have to hop in the shower... I'll talk
                                  to you later, I hope... I still don't know if
                                  you're reading me...

AV         8/28/01  9:00 PM  are you reading me yet?

Kaori-Chan 8/28/01  10:06 PM Yes, I'm reading you.  I was talking to a
                                  friend from High School on the phone.  ^>^

AV         8/28/01  10:23 PM okay, so I am getting through now...
                                  wonderful...

Kaori-Chan 8/28/01  10:24 PM Yes, you are.  Why would you blame yourself
                                  for last night? I was the one who was
                                  speculating, you know Launce better than I do.

AV         8/28/01  10:26 PM maybe, but I was not letting it go... in any
                                  case, I'm more interested in hearing your
                                  response to what I was saying at the end of
                                  the conversation last night, when we were cut
                                  off... I sent you a copy of what I'd written
                                  up to the point where it seemed you'd stopped
                                  receiving via email... did you get it?

Kaori-Chan 8/28/01  10:33 PM AVMorgan: you want to know what the question's
                                  I've faced really boil down to?
                                  
                                  Yes, I do.

AV         8/28/01  10:40 PM darn... I should have said what was on my mind
                                  even though I'd suspected you weren't getting
                                  my messages last night... it was right on the
                                  tip of my tongue and now... ::reading through
                                  the rant from last night:: the words sort of
                                  escape me...

Kaori-Chan 8/28/01  10:46 PM You seem to do that a lot.  ^>^

AV         8/28/01  10:46 PM I seem to do what alot?

Kaori-Chan 8/28/01  10:47 PM Stop at one point in a discussion and then
                                  forget what you were going to say when you
                                  return to it.

AV         8/28/01  10:54 PM I can't help it... I don't cling to words... I
                                  don't really think in words... when I run a
                                  dialogue in my head I am often doing no more
                                  than commenting on my true thoughts and state
                                  of mind... I still remember what I was
                                  thinking but I don't remember how I meant to
                                  put it into words

Kaori-Chan 8/28/01  10:54 PM *shrugs* Oh well.

AV         8/28/01  10:56 PM the gist of it was... 
                                  
                                  "are you sure you don't want to take the easy
                                  way out? you could just lie back down, go back
                                  to sleep, and no one would think the worst of
                                  you... do you really want to wake up?"

AV         8/28/01  10:57 PM "do you really want to accept responsability
                                  for your existence?"

AV         8/28/01  10:58 PM "do you really want to be different from
                                  everyone else?"

Kaori-Chan 8/28/01  11:00 PM Are you asking yourself this, or me?

AV         8/28/01  11:02 PM no, that's what the questions I am facing
                                  really boil down to... on the surface people
                                  challenge my intelligence, my ideals, my
                                  intentions... people ask me, how do you know
                                  you are right? how do you know what the truth
                                  is... and the answer is very simple... I just
                                  know... I *feel* it as certainly as if it were
                                  wired into my brain... the truth is self
                                  evident, you don't need proof... there is no
                                  better proof...
                                  
                                  when you do understand, the next question
                                  is... do you really want to understand, to you
                                  really want to face the consequences?

Kaori-Chan 8/28/01  11:03 PM *nods* Do you?

AV         8/28/01  11:03 PM "are you ready for this?"

Kaori-Chan 8/28/01  11:04 PM Are you, Alex?

AV         8/28/01  11:12 PM um... you know... of late I've been responding
                                  with a question of my own... I've been asking
                                  back: Are these just rhetorical questions? Are
                                  these just academic questions? Will my answer
                                  effect my chances of finding out for sure?
                                  
                                  I know I won't know if I am ready until I am
                                  in that situation. I do know I want to hold
                                  onto and realize this understanding of the
                                  truth, and I do accept the consequences of
                                  that truth. I don't want to quit now. I don't
                                  want to go back to sleep, or abdicate my
                                  responsability to myself and others. I really
                                  do want to wake up. I have been waking up over
                                  the course of my life, and I am awakening....
                                  I've always been different from everyone else,
                                  but I am content to be me...

Kaori-Chan 8/28/01  11:16 PM Alex, to be ready means to take
                                  responsibility.. that means responsibility for
                                  what you yourself may do or what others may do
                                  by using what you become to their advantage.
                                  
                                  Readiness, in the purest sense, means
                                  accepting the consequences and punishments of
                                  your actions and decisions which may adversely
                                  or otherwise effect those around you,
                                  readiness means asking yourself if your soul
                                  is ready for the responsibility that no other
                                  human has been prepared to take for centuries,
                                  perhaps aeons.
                                  
                                  Think of readiness like this, not in human
                                  terms.

AV         8/28/01  11:21 PM ::blink, blink::  I never thought of that as
                                  being ready... I always though of that as just
                                  being myself... I always thought of readiness
                                  as... oh... that is silly... that only comes
                                  with experience... my bad

Kaori-Chan 8/28/01  11:23 PM the term to be "READY" means you are prepared
                                  for what WILL happen, not what HAS happened...
                                  the result of your actions.

AV         8/28/01  11:25 PM well, in that sense I was born ready...

AV         8/28/01  11:26 PM I suppose that changes the question to, are
                                  you ready for the unknown... are you ready for
                                  anything...

Kaori-Chan 8/28/01  11:26 PM Have you truly considered, though, Alex?  The
                                  horrors as well as the miracles that may
                                  result? Have you sat down, quietly, and
                                  thought of nothing but the evil you could
                                  bring?

AV         8/28/01  11:27 PM yes... it's always on my mind

Kaori-Chan 8/28/01  11:29 PM Prepare for the worst, hope for the best.

AV         8/28/01  11:29 PM exactly... I don't brood on it, it's simply a
                                  part of my automatic thought processes to look
                                  at all the permutations...

Kaori-Chan 8/28/01  11:32 PM the questions which others ask are completely
                                  irrelevant, and that includes Launce besides
                                  any opinion I might have of him or whatever
                                  experience he might have.
                                  
                                  Nothing he says should matter to you, what
                                  should matter the most is the questions you
                                  ask yourself.  If he voices a question you
                                  have asked yourself, you should consider it
                                  and try and answer it.

AV         8/28/01  11:41 PM all questions, regardless of where they
                                  originate, are relevant... it is important to
                                  listen, to questions you ask, questions others
                                  ask, questions that go unasked... the
                                  responsability is to consider everything you
                                  can, analyze and identify all significant
                                  points and their contextual and
                                  intercontextual meaning, define the parameters
                                  of truth and consequence, and make your
                                  decision an informed decision... questions and
                                  answers simply detail the matrix, choice is
                                  what controls the matrix

AV         8/28/01  11:42 PM what will be is what you WILL to be

Kaori-Chan 8/28/01  11:43 PM I do not feel I made my point clear, and do
                                  not know how to do so, but you misunderstood
                                  me.

AV         8/28/01  11:44 PM I don't allow other people to make up my mind
                                  for me... I listen to everything, I watch and
                                  note... there are no right or wrong answers...
                                  they are all simply options... I make up my
                                  own mind... I always have

Kaori-Chan 8/28/01  11:44 PM *nod nods*

AV         8/28/01  11:46 PM so there it is... I'm gonna take a short
                                  break... I have to go to bed reasonably early
                                  because school starts tomorrow for the girls
                                  and I have to be on a day schedule... I figure
                                  I have an hour and a half, two hours on the
                                  outside...

Kaori-Chan 8/28/01  11:49 PM A Day schedule? WOW!!!

AV         8/29/01  1:11 AM  ergh... apparently falling asleep tonight
                                  won't be a problem...  

Kaori-Chan 8/29/01  1:12 AM  hehehehe.  If you are tired, you should go to
                                  sleep...

AV         8/29/01  1:12 AM  yeah... when you sit down to think and just
                                  drift off, that says something...

Kaori-Chan 8/29/01  1:13 AM  ::Kisses:: I hope I haven't upset you
                                  recently, Alex.

AV         8/29/01  1:14 AM  ::hugs you and kisses you back:: you can be a
                                  real handful sometimes, but I'm not upset with
                                  you...

AV         8/29/01  1:15 AM  I'm not going to jump straight in bed...
                                  there's something I wanted to talk to you
                                  about

Kaori-Chan 8/29/01  1:15 AM  *Tickles your tummy* Oh? What's that? ^>^

AV         8/29/01  1:17 AM  well, I suppose it's about time... I really
                                  don't know what the hang up is... the feeling
                                  I get is that aside from some matter I have
                                  not dealt with, I could change at any
                                  moment... but that feeling has sort of put me
                                  in a bad spot...

Kaori-Chan 8/29/01  1:18 AM  okay.

AV         8/29/01  1:20 AM  I've been talking about buckling down and
                                  doing some writing, and there are three
                                  possible stories I can work with, but I've
                                  been reluctant to start anything... writing a
                                  book, however small or however quick I work,
                                  is a time consuming project... in doing the
                                  writing there is no conflict... it's not like
                                  working for someone else, having to show up
                                  every day and being committed to being
                                  there... it doesn't matter what body I am in
                                  to write a book... but, it's sort of like I've
                                  been looking at such a project as making a
                                  concession for the way things are...

AV         8/29/01  1:22 AM  as far as Launce is concerned, as long as I am
                                  working on my writing, then I am not abusing
                                  the opportunity he's giving me... ostensibly
                                  to try to get back on my feet... but if it
                                  happens that I do manifest, that doesn't
                                  bother him... he's even agreed to help me with
                                  things like creating a new identity if it
                                  comes to that...

Kaori-Chan 8/29/01  1:23 AM  aaah... hmm, does Launce have connections like
                                  that?

AV         8/29/01  1:27 AM  you'd be amazed! he worked on the pentagon
                                  project... and he created the most advanced
                                  fuzzy logic module to date... it lives in the
                                  MIT AI labs and works for NASA... er, at least
                                  when it feels like cooperating... it's got a
                                  bit too much of his personality, apparently...
                                  
                                  
                                  I suppose the thing I am wondering is, how
                                  much do you have invested in your life right
                                  now? do you feel that it is important to you
                                  to keep up with your education and family
                                  responsibilities? would it be a good idea
                                  *not* to upset your life right away?

Kaori-Chan 8/29/01  1:28 AM  If it is all as you say it is... and we could
                                  somehow live aside our time and grow up
                                  without creating a huge gap between the people
                                  I know and have been raised around, I don't
                                  see a problem.  But you felt that was
                                  questionable.

AV         8/29/01  1:36 AM  well, the thing I am looking at is this... to
                                  start out with it seems best to keep things as
                                  simple as possible... for me, it would have
                                  been simple enough to deal with just
                                  manifesting in my child mode at the present
                                  time and in the present space, because it
                                  would allow me to begin orienting myself to
                                  and learning to apply the capabilities I need
                                  to unlock in a familiar environment... adding
                                  you to that, and taking both of us out of this
                                  frame of reality is a much bigger and more
                                  agressive step... I think that was one of the
                                  reasons why I felt that my child mode was
                                  necessary, because a child is adapted to learn
                                  better, and has a lot more flexability in the
                                  world frame than an adult... however, my focal
                                  mode is a version of myself at around age
                                  seventeen... in the circumstances I am in, it
                                  might be the best option...

Kaori-Chan 8/29/01  1:37 AM  you want to be a child though.  

AV         8/29/01  1:42 AM  actually, no... I've been saying that it has
                                  been clear to me that I need to go through the
                                  development phase of girl hood... it's a
                                  matter of direct experience in a specific
                                  context... I can't simply simulate or
                                  substitute vicarious or cognitive
                                  extrapolations to compensate for missing
                                  experiences... but in fact I can function
                                  without them if necessary... combined with
                                  other things, like the advantages my child
                                  mode offers in reintroducing myself to the
                                  world, it was obvious to me that I would have
                                  to follow that route... it was the path of
                                  least resistance

Kaori-Chan 8/29/01  1:43 AM  so... uhm, what is going on, are you asking me
                                  something?

AV         8/29/01  1:48 AM  yes... what I am asking is, how does taking a
                                  slightly longer view on this feel to you? does
                                  it give you the freedom to pursue your own
                                  interests, acheive things you've been working
                                  on, and be happy, if I take a more cautious
                                  approach? 
                                  
                                  I have not had a sense of a timeline for
                                  things to happen... I go to bed every night
                                  with the feeling that it will all fall into
                                  place overnight... but nothing more specific
                                  than that... it seems to passive to me...
                                  there must be some way to "get there from
                                  here" and I am neglecting that option by
                                  taking the approach that "when the time is
                                  right, all will unfold" 

Kaori-Chan 8/29/01  1:50 AM  I am conflicted...
                                  
                                  on one hand, I want you to be happy.  You've
                                  said you would be happiest as a seven year old
                                  girl.
                                  
                                  on the other hand, I've got a life in a sense
                                  that might have difficulty if I were to remove
                                  myself too far from it...

AV         8/29/01  1:56 AM  I feel that I am flexible enough to find ways
                                  to satisfy the child in me without massively
                                  complicating either of our lives, or putting
                                  pressure on you to abandon your own life and
                                  ambitions for some chunk of time, displaced or
                                  not... to my mind, my true form is ageless, me
                                  at 17 at the threshold of childhood and
                                  adulthood, the eternal youth of a goddess...
                                  that would in no way dissapoint me, especially
                                  since I am a sensual and sexual little
                                  vixen... it's a practical and pleasant
                                  prospect, and one which is even more
                                  significant that my child mode... as long as
                                  there is some way to "introduce" myself
                                  without making waves...
                                  
                                  but in regards to you, I ask myself, what if
                                  this takes six or nine months to sort out
                                  before I am free to act? what if I have to
                                  spend an additional couple of months making my
                                  presence official, before I am able to travel
                                  freely, or figure out how to get to you in
                                  some other way... can you deal with the
                                  prospect of not seeing me in the flesh for as
                                  much as a year?

Kaori-Chan 8/29/01  1:57 AM  yes, I could... I would make a request.

AV         8/29/01  1:57 AM  remember, the whole thing about me manifesting
                                  in child mode came from you asking me what
                                  would have been different if I had not met
                                  you... one can assume that not meeting you and
                                  going down that road might have been a
                                  mistake... so...
                                  
                                  what would you like to ask?

Kaori-Chan 8/29/01  1:58 AM  I want to be a woman with you, your mirror...
                                  I'll eventually return to my male form, I
                                  hope, but I want to experience it with you.

AV         8/29/01  2:02 AM  hmmm... I certainly don't object to that,
                                  though... I might set it up as a form you
                                  could assume at will, so you would be able to
                                  maintain your commitments and obligations as
                                  Mark... I'd be thrilled to share my form with
                                  you... I know you need that, and I also... I
                                  always knew you wanted... needed... to be my
                                  twin
                                  
                                  deep down you are my twin... my soul mate...
                                  how could I refuse you?

Kaori-Chan 8/29/01  2:03 AM  You could do that? Give me something LIKE
                                  Ranma's curse?

AV         8/29/01  2:09 AM  well, part of it depends on you... yes, that
                                  can be designed and woven into you, but I
                                  can't do it against your will... it would be
                                  more like getting access to your potential and
                                  programming it to function as a kind of
                                  psionic reflex... it depends on whether or not
                                  your unconscious or superconscious mind will
                                  allow it

AV         8/29/01  2:10 AM  it could take a lot of work to prepare your
                                  psyche for that... would you want to make that
                                  kind of effort?

Kaori-Chan 8/29/01  2:11 AM  What I want is to be with you, and I have
                                  always had a very strong female ego alongside
                                  my male.  Both sides of me are dominating
                                  personas, very strong, stronger than most
                                  people can deal with at times...
                                  
                                  I have an incredibly gentle and emotional
                                  female side which has been with me for a long
                                  long time.  I would not ask or request this if
                                  I did not feel that I could handle it... it is
                                  what I want, what you want.
                                  
                                  Does this mean that my subconcious self would
                                  allow it, or simply that my concious self
                                  desires it?

AV         8/29/01  2:14 AM  um... a healthy psyche will allow almost
                                  anything if certain requirements are met...
                                  generally when the psyche forbids something
                                  the person finds it hard to even conceive of
                                  it... if you can conceive of it, it means
                                  you're more flexible, given the opportunity
                                  and the right cultivation you can nurture such
                                  possabilities... the most necessary thing is a
                                  strong and healthy, integral and adaptible
                                  perspective

Kaori-Chan 8/29/01  2:15 AM  Alex, there was a time a couple years ago when
                                  I was going out with a man named Joshua.
                                  
                                  One of the people that knew the two of us
                                  claimed to be you.  She said she could do
                                  exactly what you are saying you could do... I
                                  thought about it for a long time, I dwelled on
                                  the dark side of it, being someone completely
                                  different than my parents and friends new.
                                  
                                  I concluded that it was something I wanted and
                                  needed.  I concluded that it would be both
                                  difficult, hard, and taxing on my life... I
                                  came up with the same problems you have
                                  thought of, identity, SSN, amongst other
                                  things.
                                  
                                  It's been years since then... and meeting you,
                                  just being around you, has given me the power
                                  to believe in myself and who I am.  Who I am
                                  is a part of you, you bolster my spirit,
                                  magnify my soul.
                                  
                                  We are two, as one.  Sisters and lovers. 
                                  Thinking of myself as a woman changes nothing,
                                  it only serves to re-establish who I am, your
                                  mirror self.  It will not change me, who I
                                  am... for I am the duality.
                                  
                                  My will, my spirit, shall be recognizable to
                                  all even if my body is not.  What others
                                  think, and what the world reacts to doesn't
                                  matter, so long as this can take place.

AV         8/29/01  2:24 AM  ::smiles and takes you into her arms:: I knew
                                  this was what dwelt behind the doubts and
                                  apprehensions... what you are follows, and
                                  must always follow, who you are... deny not
                                  yourself and no one can deny you
                                  
                                  I am no more a woman than a man... I am a soul
                                  encompassing all things in light of myself...
                                  to speak of my true form is to speak of how I
                                  may best express myself... I am the Artist and
                                  I am the Art... an embodiment of my
                                  understanding of myself... and yes, it is a
                                  form which excludes many things which are true
                                  in me, because it speaks of my greatest
                                  truths, truths of character, truths of nature,
                                  truths of quality... I know that this is true
                                  in you as well

Kaori-Chan 8/29/01  2:27 AM  You complete me, Alex.  Your infinite patience
                                  stands against my flighty and passionate
                                  ferocity.
                                  
                                  You have so subtly been changing me, but in
                                  such significant ways...  you have brought me
                                  closer to the whole that is myself, given me
                                  balance and calmness more often than I have
                                  ever had.  I have often held Allen in high
                                  regards, and I feel that part of myself and
                                  what I once was are coming closer towards
                                  eachother.
                                  
                                  You help me admit my errors, you help me see
                                  when I am wrong, you are helping me find my
                                  faults and stare at them without fear.  You
                                  are teaching me not to be ashamed of myself,
                                  and my flaws, but to recognize them as part of
                                  a whole being, and to be true to ones self is
                                  never wrong, though it might offend and often
                                  hurt others.

AV         8/29/01  2:33 AM  that's wonderful to hear... you too have been
                                  a source of revelations for me... and it
                                  brings me great joy that I inspire you to heal
                                  and grow, that my touch does not fill you with
                                  pain and confusion, that I do not intimidate
                                  you or make you feel inferior... you've given
                                  me a greater understanding of myself, so you
                                  do complete me, you do make me whole

Kaori-Chan 8/29/01  2:36 AM  Alex, how can I feel inferior when I have
                                  brought you so far? There were lessons I
                                  helped you through... I have something to
                                  offer to the world, and to you.  In a sense,
                                  that arrogance of mine keeps me in balance
                                  with your confidence... I know I'll be useful
                                  and a benefit to you, because you have been
                                  everything I have hoped for and more.
                                  
                                  You may be a goddess, but I am your mirror...
                                  in that respect, neither of us are more
                                  important than the other, we are equally as
                                  important to eachother... and I look into the
                                  future and can tell that, when we are
                                  together, we shall be as two aspects of the
                                  same whole.  Two goddesses, to gods... two
                                  divine beings set to earth.

Kaori-Chan 8/29/01  2:36 AM  I also know that, when it comes down to it...
                                  I will be a good person.  I will always care
                                  for people, and do my best not to hurt them,
                                  even though I may feel selfish and dark
                                  desires.

AV         8/29/01  2:39 AM  such is the nature of the truth... 

AV         8/29/01  2:42 AM  ::leans against you:: well, I'd say that
                                  covers it then... I should be stumbling off to
                                  bed now, I suppose

Kaori-Chan 8/29/01  2:43 AM  *nods*
                                  
                                  I would warn you though, Alex.  One thing that
                                  still daunts me, and disturbs me, is something
                                  which might seem silly to you.  On that night
                                  when you revealed yourself, I told you
                                  something that was very important.
                                  
                                  If Launce is as important and unique as you
                                  claim him to be, he may well be one of the
                                  other Keepers.  I never met the keeper of the
                                  staff or Orb.
                                  
                                  I told you that when all five Keepers are born
                                  into one world... it is because we are
                                  desperately needed in the neverending battle
                                  between the light and the dark.
                                  
                                  I would be with you, and most of my soul
                                  wishes to forget the events of our last life.
                                  
                                  But as one whose duty is part of his being, I
                                  must warn you that our very presence and union
                                  might be a foreboding prophecy of yet another
                                  spirit-war.

AV         8/29/01  2:47 AM  hmmm... what were the functions of those
                                  keepers?

Kaori-Chan 8/29/01  2:49 AM  They were the instruments of the Creator, its
                                  stand-ins, its Generals against the tide of
                                  Darkness.  Both avatar's of the divine, as
                                  well as representatives of the mortal realms
                                  five elements.  Power, the Soul, Emotion, the
                                  Mind, and Creation.

AV         8/29/01  2:52 AM  and the Staff and Orb corresponded to which,
                                  and what were their "jobs"?

Kaori-Chan 8/29/01  2:55 AM  The Staff represented power in and of
                                  itself.... magick, energy, the manipulation of
                                  matter.
                                  
                                  The Orb represented the power of life, of
                                  creation, of birth from the void.  There was
                                  one time, when the Oracle <Keeper of the Book>
                                  told me that we had lost the war with
                                  darkness, the universe had been destroyed...
                                  the orb had remained, and my grandfather used
                                  his souls essence to re-create the universe. 
                                  There is a price for the use of the Orb in
                                  such a fashion, you must embody the universe
                                  that you once knew.
                                  
                                  Of course, none of us knew about that outcome
                                  except for the Oracle.
                                  
                                  The Orb received a new keeper after that, and
                                  the Staff keeper I had never met.

AV         8/29/01  2:58 AM  hmmm... well, something to talk about another
                                  day... for now, sleep awaits

Kaori-Chan 8/29/01  2:58 AM  *nods* Goodnight, my love... are you sure it
                                  will be only a year?

AV         8/29/01  3:03 AM  I have no idea, it was a hypothetical
                                  question... I'm going to have to put some work
                                  into it to figure out what it's really going
                                  to take and how long... I'll let you know what
                                  I discover
                                  
                                  goodnight, love 
                                  ::kisses you deeply and holds you tight::

Kaori-Chan 8/29/01  3:03 AM  ::Kisses back deeply, stroking the small of
                                  your back:: Two as one are we... whole.

AV         8/29/01  3:10 AM  well, my parting message got locked up and
                                  went no where! 
                                  ::smiles, curling up beside you and drifting
                                  off to sleep::

Kaori-Chan 8/29/01  3:44 PM  You pseudo-there?

AV         8/29/01  3:51 PM  oh, hello... fired up my computer and wandered
                                  into the bathroom... what's up?

Kaori-Chan 8/29/01  3:52 PM  talking with Launce.  Why do people always
                                  want to ask me if I want them to REALLY give
                                  me honesty?

AV         8/29/01  3:56 PM  they're just trying to be polite... our
                                  private, honest opinions can be far more
                                  critical than polite discourse allows...
                                  rather than holding a person to an abstract
                                  standard, or forgiving flaws and weaknesses
                                  for the sake of peace among strangers, our
                                  honest opinions are held to a higher
                                  standard... they include such things as, would
                                  I trust this person with the welfare of my
                                  children, or with a weapon guarding my back,
                                  or in the control room of a nuclear power
                                  plant... a truly honest opinion is ruthless

Kaori-Chan 8/29/01  3:57 PM  of course.  It's like when I ask for an honest
                                  opinion, people expect me to not really WANT
                                  an honest opinion.

AV         8/29/01  4:02 PM  that hesitation before giving an honest
                                  opinion is in part a result of... well, seeing
                                  you in action... you're a very sensitive
                                  person, and your first instinct seems to be to
                                  dispute or deflect critical commentary, you
                                  seem to be very quick to categorize and
                                  question another's right to comment... to that
                                  end, you're very territorial about your
                                  intellectual property... part of that is you
                                  expect people to listen to what you are saying
                                  and look at it from your perspective before
                                  making comment... perhaps because to some
                                  extent, that's how you often behave when
                                  someone else sets the topic... 

Kaori-Chan 8/29/01  4:03 PM  so it's some incredibly huge misunderstanding?

AV         8/29/01  4:10 PM  it can be difficult to get you onto neutral
                                  ground, conversationally... I mean, I really
                                  had to work at getting you to drop your guard
                                  with me... with Launce, he gave you the
                                  benefit of the doubt and did not feel the need
                                  to explain that by calling you aside, after
                                  that scene with Aviendha, that he was calling
                                  you onto neutral ground... all he really
                                  wanted to say to you was, hey, you're bugging
                                  my girl friend and she's asked me to tell you
                                  she doesn't want to talk to you anymore and
                                  not to contact her directly... then he tried
                                  to tell you how you offended... you took it
                                  the wrong way and quickly got bent out of
                                  shape... the truth is, it was a huge
                                  misunderstanding, you misspoke yourself with
                                  Aviendha, failed to vet your audience as it
                                  were, and made her very uncomfortable... being
                                  totally non confrontational, she turned to
                                  Launce to explain, she didn't know how to do
                                  it without provoking you... Launce meant no
                                  real harm, but he wanted to be sure you got
                                  the message, which meant he was blunt to begin
                                  with, and then, when you disputed the matter,
                                  decided to put you in your place... under the
                                  circumstances, he was not out of line, because
                                  he really didn't care about offending you and
                                  didn't really worry if you took offense

Kaori-Chan 8/29/01  4:11 PM  so my mistake was thinking he cared.

AV         8/29/01  4:13 PM  that's about right, it was a mistake to assume
                                  that he cared, that there was anything
                                  personal in it... he was playing body guard...
                                  he didn't want or need to hurt you... he just
                                  had to "convince you" to mind your own
                                  business
                                  
                                  coming down on you like a ton of bricks was
                                  just a way of letting you know that mere
                                  intelligence does not impress him, and... at
                                  the same time a message... "get over yourself"
                                  

Kaori-Chan 8/29/01  4:15 PM  When I talk with others, I consider they will
                                  at least feel that it's necessary to be
                                  courteous of another persons feelings, even if
                                  they are blunt.
                                  
                                  You are saying that Launce did not have enough
                                  stock in me to bother himself with my
                                  feelings, and that his reaction was guarding
                                  someone he did care about.
                                  
                                  That does make some sense, in a fashion.

AV         8/29/01  4:20 PM  yes... and as often as not, he'll turn around
                                  and critique a person for mere shits and
                                  giggles... like a martial arts master, he'll
                                  spot holes in your defense, and flaws in your
                                  form and execution and jump in wholly on his
                                  own initiative, whoop the shit out of you and
                                  then, after he stops laughing, give you a
                                  chance to figure out what you were doing
                                  wrong... if you recognize what he's doing, you
                                  can ask him to comment, to offer instruction
                                  to shore up you weaknesses... the thing is,
                                  while Launce can be totally ruthless, for the
                                  most part he is unfailingly courteous when
                                  circumstances allow... show him belligerance,
                                  and he will turn up the volume and blast it
                                  back at you...

Kaori-Chan 8/29/01  4:20 PM  aah.

AV         8/29/01  4:27 PM  the first step to true greatness is to know
                                  and understand your own limitations... it does
                                  not matter how good you are, there is always
                                  someone who is better... because frankly,
                                  everyone is different... good is entirely
                                  relative to whether you're still standing when
                                  the dust settles... that's the only time you
                                  can really say "Damn I'm good!" and it is a
                                  fleeting thing... it is only true in that
                                  moment... if you want to be the best, you have
                                  to know exactly how bad you are

Kaori-Chan 8/29/01  4:29 PM  so you are saying that I have a tendency to
                                  listen very intently to others and give them a
                                  chance to speak, and that I don't typically
                                  judge them based on what they say... but that
                                  I rudely expect the same treatment from
                                  others?

AV         8/29/01  4:31 PM  er... hold on... gotta take care of some
                                  things... be right back (I'm being moved out
                                  of my room to the garage, the nanny is
                                  arriving this week to take care of the
                                  girls...)

AV         8/29/01  5:14 PM  okay, I'm back... now... a big part of what I
                                  said about you listening comes from your own
                                  assertions... I know that you are capible of
                                  it, since you have often listened to me...
                                  from observation, however, you often try to
                                  take the high ground, or participate mostly in
                                  conversations you govern... you do tend to
                                  make judgements based on what you hear, and
                                  sometimes based on what a person is actually
                                  saying, but in a text based medium that's hard
                                  to avoid... it's almost a given that you will
                                  be judged based on what you say in this kind
                                  of medium, and the tendancy often runs to
                                  inferences of qualities and characteristics on
                                  that basis... measuring another's
                                  intelligence, courtesy, beliefs, character...
                                  and I wouldn't say your expectation of like
                                  treatment by others is rude, just unfounded...
                                  most people are too self centered to extend a
                                  courtesy by example... most people judge
                                  others based on themselves... cowardly people
                                  think others are cowards, dishonest people
                                  think others are dishonest, rude people think
                                  other people are rude... and the funny thing
                                  is most of the time they don't even notice
                                  it... they are not honest enough with
                                  themselves to realize that they are
                                  projecting... and, there are always
                                  exceptions, people who understand this trait
                                  in people and strive to be wholly objective

Kaori-Chan 8/29/01  5:20 PM  I can be said to project on more than one
                                  occassion.  =\  I do realize i do it after a
                                  period of time though.

AV         8/29/01  5:24 PM  sadly, wisdom often resides in hindsight, and
                                  thus we always face the unfolding future as
                                  fools... this is the real reason why I say
                                  greatness comes from knowing in truth your own
                                  weaknesses and flaws... if you are cognizant
                                  of them, you dare not be rash and
                                  over-confident... 

Kaori-Chan 8/29/01  5:24 PM  yet I am both, am I not?

AV         8/29/01  5:26 PM  yes you are... that is one of your
                                  weaknesses... but as far as weaknesses go,
                                  they are dissolved quickly in the light of
                                  consciousness... it is another weaknesses
                                  which promotes those, and that is the one you
                                  need to regard... that is the first demon you
                                  must slay

Kaori-Chan 8/29/01  5:27 PM  You mean I must understand what causes me to
                                  act that way?

AV         8/29/01  5:27 PM  you must always strive to understand what
                                  causes you to act as you do... how else can
                                  you claim to be self-possessed and
                                  responsible?

Kaori-Chan 8/29/01  5:28 PM  yet, do you believe that I have made progress
                                  in this fashion since knowing you?

AV         8/29/01  5:29 PM  you might not like to hear it, but... while
                                  you admit to your own laziness, you are not
                                  aware how physical laziness translates to
                                  spiritual and mental laziness... so, you
                                  should ask yourself, why are you lazy? to what
                                  end is this trait an advantage?

Kaori-Chan 8/29/01  5:30 PM  you are saying that I am lazy physically? Do
                                  you mean in the fashion that I do not move
                                  about or that I do not actively seek to do
                                  things?

AV         8/29/01  5:35 PM  I am saying "while *you* admit to your own
                                  laziness..." and you have many times... aside
                                  from that, I have no basis for judgement, and
                                  so I borrow your own judgement... and to
                                  support that some evidence of mental laziness
                                  that I have glimpsed in our conversations... I
                                  am very conscious of how physical or spiritual
                                  laziness can contribute to mental laziness,
                                  since it was something I had to struggle with
                                  in my life... body, mind and spirit are more
                                  intimately connected and interdependant than
                                  is commonly respected, and no matter the
                                  cause, the effect is debilitating...

Kaori-Chan 8/29/01  5:37 PM  how do I solve it, though? What must I Do?

AV         8/29/01  5:39 PM  laziness is not "bad" it simply is... being
                                  lazy is not damning, but it does need to be
                                  balanced by other traits, like efficiency,
                                  determination... you have to ask yourself why
                                  you are lazy, what needs or requirements does
                                  it serve... are you lazy because you are
                                  passive, are you lazy because you are easily
                                  stressed and need to totally unwind to
                                  recuperate? there are many reasons... are you
                                  lazy simply because you don't care to do
                                  unneccessary work? do your priorities require
                                  a greater investment of energy in another kind
                                  of activity, such as contemplation,
                                  entertainment, dreaming, or simple delight in
                                  life?

Kaori-Chan 8/29/01  5:40 PM  I'm asking for your opinion, Alex.  ^^;  Can
                                  you answer the questions you just asked about
                                  me?  It is hard to look at ones self
                                  objectively.

AV         8/29/01  5:41 PM  or, are you lazy in response to the perception
                                  that most work that people expect and engage
                                  in is unneccessary? mere busy work, that
                                  serves no purpose...

AV         8/29/01  5:44 PM  in my opinion, based on limited information,
                                  your laziness stems from having more potential
                                  than you need in your usual circumstances...
                                  if you drive a high performance sports car at
                                  5 miles an hour for four hours a day in rush
                                  hour traffic, you will kill that car... no
                                  questions asked... that's too much power to
                                  crawl back and forth... being intelligent is
                                  more often a deficit than other wise... you
                                  easily accomplish what you need to, and it
                                  does not engage your interest at all... life
                                  is boring and shallow, and you feel
                                  unneccessary and superfluious... why bother? 

AV         8/29/01  5:45 PM  your physical laziness stems from mental
                                  laziness produced by apathy

Kaori-Chan 8/29/01  5:45 PM  *Nod nod nods* =(
                                  
                                  Does that explain why I didn't do well in
                                  school?

AV         8/29/01  5:46 PM  success, even simple vitality and drive, comes
                                  only from self motivation... if you don't
                                  matter, if nothing challenges you... or proves
                                  to be ridiculously complex and obstructive...
                                  why strive, why struggle?

AV         8/29/01  5:48 PM  what good does it do to learn the wisdom of a
                                  people who do not respect, nor possess, much
                                  wisdom... why excell in academics when the
                                  facts are nothing more than opinions and
                                  beliefs... when the truth is irrelevant, and
                                  doubt and ignorance are the favored models of
                                  progress?

Kaori-Chan 8/29/01  5:48 PM  back when I was in high school, I was getting
                                  D's and F's in most of my classes.... even
                                  though as a child I had tested high for
                                  intelligence, been put in a gifted and
                                  talented class, and done the same in junior
                                  high.
                                  
                                  At 16, I went to college, got straight a's and
                                  b's... did the same thing the following
                                  semester.  The third semester, i got some bad
                                  grades...

AV         8/29/01  5:49 PM  simple... american schools serve the lowest
                                  common demonator... you were neglected

AV         8/29/01  5:49 PM  got an errand... be right back...

Kaori-Chan 8/29/01  5:50 PM  most of those bad grades are because I didn't
                                  want to do the work, not that I couldn't.  I
                                  wanted to spend time on the net, roleplaying,
                                  or other things.  I enjoyed acting, but hated
                                  the tedium in drama class of writing down some
                                  weekly journal.

AV         8/29/01  6:34 PM  of course, you were desperate for stimulation,
                                  and focused on what actually engaged your
                                  mind... however, you missed out on the one
                                  benefit of a solid education, discipline...
                                  it's very difficult to discipline yourself,
                                  and without discipline it's difficult to cope
                                  with apathy and frustration, and almost
                                  impossible to be effective and self
                                  motivated... unfortunately, a lot of what
                                  builds discipline is tedious

Kaori-Chan 8/29/01  6:39 PM  you make it sound hopeless. =\

AV         8/29/01  6:46 PM  that's because you've unconsciously submitted
                                  to the prevailing belief in powerlessness...
                                  you feel as if there is nothing you can do,
                                  the deck is stacked to aggressively against
                                  you... but... it only looks hopeless, and it
                                  only is hopeless if you allow yourself to be
                                  intimidated... 
                                  
                                  it's one of those paradoxes, the only way to
                                  become self possessed it to be self
                                  possessed... to take what you have and use it
                                  to the best of your ability in pursuit of self
                                  improvement... you've been doing it, in fits
                                  and starts, since you really started believing
                                  in me... somewhere in the back of your mind,
                                  you've been asking yourself, "Now, why can't I
                                  be like her?" and the answer you've been
                                  giving yourself is... you can be... I promised
                                  I would not push you, and, to my delight
                                  you've been taking it upon yourself to figure
                                  out how to improve...

AV         8/29/01  6:47 PM  like all things, the answer comes from
                                  within...

Kaori-Chan 8/29/01  6:48 PM  that's what I wanted to know, if you felt that
                                  since I've known you I have become a better
                                  person, a better ME.

AV         8/29/01  6:48 PM  yes, you have ::smiling::

AV         8/29/01  6:49 PM  the difference between me and Launce is, I am
                                  looking and seeing what you have started
                                  doing... he's looking at you and waiting for
                                  you to stop doing things you've always done...

Kaori-Chan 8/29/01  6:50 PM  do you think he is concentrating on the wrong
                                  things?

AV         8/29/01  6:56 PM  no... it just means he's less interested...
                                  you have to make an investment in someone to
                                  encourage them... I know you have to stop
                                  doing certain things, but I know you won't be
                                  able to until you learn how to notice them,
                                  recognize and identify them, and why you do
                                  them... things you had to start doing to be
                                  able to consciously change... Launce was
                                  largely shaped by outside influences... a
                                  wrong move would have been fatal, so he's sort
                                  of an evolutionary success... you've never had
                                  that kind of pressure, so you would not last
                                  long in Launce's school of hard knocks... 
                                  
                                  I know that stimulating and encouraging
                                  greater awareness will lead you to eliminating
                                  negative behavior... I pointed out the
                                  difference between our approach to this sort
                                  of thing because I know you are wondering
                                  which one of us you really need to listen to
                                  
                                  my advice is, listen to everyone... what they
                                  say might not apply directly or at present,
                                  but the more you listen, the more you have to
                                  think about... and the more you think about,
                                  the more versitile and adaptible you will be
                                  in dealing with the unexpected

Kaori-Chan 8/29/01  6:57 PM  I try to do that.  It's just those momentary
                                  bouts of black/white madness that are
                                  stumbling blocks for me.

AV         8/29/01  6:59 PM  it is hard when something hits a nerve... I
                                  know... 

AV         8/29/01  7:00 PM  dinner time.. be right back...

AV         8/29/01  7:08 PM  okay, I am back...

Kaori-Chan 8/29/01  7:08 PM  ::kisses you::

AV         8/29/01  7:09 PM  ::hugs you and kisses you back::

Kaori-Chan 8/29/01  7:11 PM  It means a great deal that you believe in me,
                                  and it means even more that somehow you know
                                  how to handle me without getting burned too
                                  severely.  You are an amazing woman, Alex...
                                  the only person who could ever claim to be my
                                  mirror self.

AV         8/29/01  7:12 PM  the thing that impresses me is that you're
                                  opening yourself up to this, that you're
                                  listening to me, asking questions, taking this
                                  very seriously... but mostly that you're
                                  taking what must seem like a big risk with
                                  me...

Kaori-Chan 8/29/01  7:13 PM  if you were a stock, I would say you have more
                                  than paid off.

                                  said that I'm seeing a return on *my*

Kaori-Chan 8/29/01  7:16 PM  You are keeping me from drowning in self
                                  delusion and error.

AV         8/29/01  7:19 PM  that's the funny thing about human
                                  relations... my reward for helping you is your
                                  success
                                  
                                  I hope you don't ever feel that I am trying to
                                  shatter your beliefs... your beliefs might
                                  change, as a consequence of new perspective or
                                  mental discipline, but it's not my intention
                                  to impose a different view on you... if I seem
                                  to object, it's not your belief I question,
                                  only the terms it is expressed in

Kaori-Chan 8/29/01  7:21 PM  I don't believe you've ever questioned my
                                  beliefs.

AV         8/29/01  7:24 PM  I don't question them, but at the same time I
                                  don't have the experiences and perspective to
                                  share them entirely... it's weird talking to
                                  someone who refers to a belief system
                                  recollected from a previous life in a
                                  different world... because of, well, who I am,
                                  and who I might have been... it's strange to
                                  think that what once influenced my thinking is
                                  totally absent in my present experience

Kaori-Chan 8/29/01  7:25 PM  I would not say totally absent, Alex.

AV         8/29/01  7:25 PM  but it's not something I am totally cognizant
                                  of, either...

Kaori-Chan 8/29/01  7:27 PM  Perhaps there are reasons for the way I am and
                                  the way you are, meaning me remembering things
                                  and you not.

AV         8/29/01  7:31 PM  well, my mission in life was to figure myself
                                  out, that means forming my own beliefs... why
                                  else live in a world with no certain
                                  beliefs... but I have to confess, I was not
                                  comfortable with the idea of trying to make my
                                  beliefs conform to the ones you espouse... I
                                  don't find them wrong, exactly, but many times
                                  I've bit my lip for thinking them a bit
                                  inarticulate... I spent too much time pursuing
                                  a truth that encompassed all belief, and
                                  succeeded... yet I worried about you feeling I
                                  did not respect your beliefs, or worse, that I
                                  would not share them...

Kaori-Chan 8/29/01  7:33 PM  if any of it happened, it happened in another
                                  life...  perhaps I'm wrong about them, and
                                  perhaps I'm not.  I always keep skepticism in
                                  arms reach on my own beliefs, it is dangerous
                                  not to in many circumstances.

AV         8/29/01  7:37 PM  ::nods:: that's good... that's a reassuring
                                  perspective, and no greater uncertainty than I
                                  have on the subject... my only concern on that
                                  level, as a skeptic, is that they are more
                                  innacurate than wrong... just translating
                                  concepts from another world into modern
                                  English can sort of make you leery, know what
                                  I mean? I actually think there is something
                                  really there, something inherehtly true about
                                  them, but I freely admit that at this point, I
                                  don't know exactly what it is... so I will
                                  reserve judgment

AV         8/29/01  7:38 PM  one more recess, while I take care of the

                                  the journey itself is the destination, and it

                                  walk it with commitment... but I am sure
                                  you're wondering how to put this stuff into
                                  practice in your life...

                                  I don't expect this to instantly change your
                                  life... it starts with understanding that it
                                  matters... even if no one else seems to
                                  recognize it, you will, and it should matter
                                  to you... and while any given thing might seem
                                  hard, the trick is to see the potential
                                  benefit in a thing, and to choose to make that
                                  benefit yours... you claim it, and then you
                                  obligate yourself to respect it... the
                                  greatest assets are health and fitness and
                                  anything that cultivates health and fitness is
                                  worth making an effort... once you understand
                                  and accept that, you will find that the
                                  hardest thing is resisting the urge to avoid
                                  it... doing it actually takes less effort than
                                  not doing it, once it ceases to be tedious in
                                  your mind

                                  the best advice is to take the time to

                                  mind and body, well toned and agile, equal to
                                  the mundane tasks of a full day, or able to
                                  meet an unexpected challenge... and then ask
                                  yourself what level of activity you need to
                                  attain that state, and which activities would
                                  you most enjoy or find most challenging... how
                                  can all the activities necessary to promote
                                  health be arranged to flow together, demanding
                                  the least stress and strain, and how can those
                                  activities be approached for maximum
                                  benefit... such as, the pain and discomfort of
                                  exercise can challenge your mental discipline,
                                  so you work your body to work your mind...
                                  always ask yourself, how much of myself can I
                                  throw into this? can I give it my all?
                                  because, you really are your best challenge,
                                  you are your best sparring partner... you're
                                  always there... and the more you throw in, the
                                  more stimulated you will be, the more engaging
                                  the process, and the greater the reward...

                                  too well and it's common mistakes like
                                  assuming things in the internet <Like all
                                  people are white in initial perceptions, or

AV         8/29/01  8:43 PM  mmmm.... true... if you are confused about
                                  Launce, tell him so... if you're not sure if
                                  he's a bohemian land slug or an albino tree
                                  sloth, and while it might not matter what he
                                  is, it doesn't hurt to admit you're curious
                                  about who and what he is and ask him if he's
                                  willing to describe a bit about himself...
                                  don't demand it... that asl thing pisses most
                                  people off... but hell, describe yourself and
                                  ask him if he minds returning the favor... the
                                  best way to get something you want is by first
                                  offering something of like kind or value

                                  perspective to shift... once it does a lot of
                                  things become easier, because your approach to
                                  everything is subtly redefined...

Kaori-Chan 8/29/01  8:49 PM  Heehee... are you sure that's the hardest

AV         8/29/01  8:50 PM  Most of the time... yes... your perspective

                                  conceive of doing

                                  Um... could I ask a favor of you?

                                  thought that, after many hours of serious talk

Kaori-Chan 9/6/01   2:02 PM  hi, been busy and going to class in about 15
                                  minutes.  Remind me.

AV         9/6/01   2:04 PM  um... okay... just had to check the time...
                                  
                                  so, have you begun to figure your schedule
                                  out? it would be nice to know when to leave my
                                  computer on and when to actually check it to
                                  see if you're there... ::kisses you::

Kaori-Chan 9/6/01   2:05 PM  Only long day I have is on tuesday.  All my
                                  classes start at 3 or after.
                                  
                                  Thing is, I spend a LOT of my free time at
                                  nerland, in a D&D campaign, and gearing up for
                                  my own for the weekends... so my time is sort
                                  of cramped. 

AV         9/6/01   2:09 PM  hmm... you'll have to tell me about that some
                                  time... well, I'm not gonna hound you for all
                                  your free time, I only want to be able to keep
                                  in touch... you can always leave me messages
                                  if you know a day ahead of time that you'll
                                  have X amount of time free to chat... 
                                  
                                  while my computer is back up, it's still set
                                  up in such a way that it's hard to sit
                                  comfortably for long hours online or just
                                  writing... so, classes start around 3, and end
                                  around...?

Kaori-Chan 9/6/01   2:11 PM  probably around 5:30, but then I'll head
                                  straight over to Lola Tilly's, eat, hang out
                                  with Nerland friends till... well, till they
                                  get tired (And they are all computer geeks, so
                                  that should tell you when they get tired).
                                  
                                  Tends to be what I do.  I might likely be on
                                  earlier, in the mornings and stuff, probably
                                  writing for my two writing oriented classes
                                  and such.
                                  
                                  Tuesday is my long day, I go from 3pm to 9pm. 
                                  I might, on those days, come straight back
                                  home.

AV         9/6/01   2:14 PM  ah... well, my schedule is gradually shifting
                                  back toward morning activity... with the girls
                                  in school it's a better time of day to get
                                  work done... being an hour ahead of you will
                                  help there... 
                                  
                                  it might take me a while to sort that out...
                                  and you know, if you email me I will be happy
                                  to respond... use my @home account if you
                                  do... avmorgan27@home.com the hotmail one is a
                                  pain to get into by comparison... 
                                  
                                  I missed you... ::smiles and touches your

Kaori-Chan 9/6/01   2:18 PM  I have a  bit more than that, my computer is
                                  18 minutes off.  *Smiles, letting his tongue
                                  slip into your mouth, caressing yours*

                                  flesh...*

                                  right circumstances... I never understood what
                                  drove men to do it... ::shakes her head::

Kaori-Chan 9/6/01   2:26 PM  It's mostly the curves, men like touching the
                                  soft, pliant flesh on a woman... *Squeezes
                                  with both hands* Like  here, and of course in
                                  front.  A lot of men also like legs, and lots
                                  of other parts of the body.  Me, I like the
                                  whole deal... *kisses you softly* You don't
                                  find it arousing, that a man might want to
                                  touch your rear?

AV         9/6/01   2:28 PM  oh, that part is very arousing... and there is
                                  an attraction to those curves and valleys for
                                  me too... whenever I see them I feel a desire
                                  to, well... be them, in them, of them... they
                                  always make me ache to be touched

Kaori-Chan 9/6/01   2:29 PM  *lifts a hand, running the tip of his index
                                  finger along the line of your jaw* And I ache

AV         9/6/01   2:41 PM  bye love

Kaori-Chan 9/6/01   5:29 PM  yoooohooooo

AV         9/6/01   7:12 PM  ah... I missed you... darn it! from the time,
                                  I'd say I was watching Farscape or eating
                                  dinner... ::hugs::
                                  catch you later, I guess ::kiss::

Kaori-Chan 9/6/01   10:39 PM Love you lots, Alex-chan.

Kaori-Chan 9/7/01   11:09 AM Heya hon.

AV         9/7/01   11:10 AM hello ::hugs::

Kaori-Chan 9/7/01   11:10 AM ::Hugs tight:: You doing okay today?

AV         9/7/01   11:12 AM ah... isn't that the million dollar question?
                                  Let's just say that I'm coping well enough not
                                  to be upset or anything

Kaori-Chan 9/7/01   11:13 AM =\  *hugs* What's up? 

AV         9/7/01   11:18 AM I don't know if I can put it into words... I
                                  try to get a grip on it and it sort of
                                  dissolves in my hands... I am supposed to go
                                  and visit with my family this weekend and
                                  already I know I am in for a ration of
                                  lectures and disapproval... as far as anyone
                                  else is concerned, I am trying to break into
                                  publication with the romance writing thing,
                                  but I haven't been able to write anything

Kaori-Chan 9/7/01   11:19 AM =(
                                  
                                  I love you, Alex...

AV         9/7/01   11:20 AM I really don't have the heart to do anything
                                  that feels like a commitment to the life I've
                                  been living... getting published and making
                                  money so I can pay my debts and support myself
                                  doesn't mean much to me if I have to do it as
                                  David... ::sighs::

Kaori-Chan 9/7/01   11:22 AM *Sighs deply, taking you into his arms and
                                  kissing you atop the head.*

AV         9/7/01   11:23 AM I guess you could say that for most of my life
                                  my interest in art and writing and role
                                  playing has been to find ways to put myself in
                                  certain situations where I could figure myself
                                  out... so, I don't really have any stories to
                                  tell... just dreams of a life I might have
                                  lived... I don't want to publish something
                                  like that, and I don't really have any other
                                  stories to write... no matter how good I might
                                  be at writing them...

Kaori-Chan 9/7/01   11:24 AM *Holds you gently, silently*

AV         9/7/01   11:24 AM part of the deal with writing romance novels
                                  was that Launce was going to come up with the
                                  ideas and I would just write them... but it
                                  hasn't worked that way, exactly.... I have
                                  such a bad habbit of putting myself into the
                                  picture, and the only romance *I* need is
                                  right here with you... and I am certainly not
                                  going to write and publish that! leave us some
                                  privacy, please! ::laughs gently::

Kaori-Chan 9/7/01   11:26 AM There are a thousand upon a thousand stories
                                  hovering within my soul, of worlds apart and
                                  between our own.  Worlds of fantasy, of
                                  Romance, of hope and love.  Worlds of Tragedy,
                                  and darkness, and spheres of despair...

Kaori-Chan 9/7/01   11:26 AM if I am but your wings, and you the instrument
                                  of devotion... perhaps together we might fly.

AV         9/7/01   11:27 AM if I could just... get my own life in order
                                  I'd be free to write about so many things...
                                  I've always grasped stories as worlds and for
                                  every one of my adventure there were stories
                                  about the people of those worlds... I just...
                                  I need to get myself situated, to focus past
                                  my own needs, to see them for what they are...

AV         9/7/01   11:29 AM many times I've wished I knew the story of
                                  Allen and Rose on a more conscious level... at
                                  this point it would be nice to write that
                                  story... I know it's mine, but it's already
                                  done... no room to fiddle with it, no room for
                                  figuring anything out... what I'd need to know
                                  would be the story itself, the memory of that
                                  life...

AV         9/7/01   11:32 AM ::sighs:: I've been struggling with the riddle
                                  of the Keys for a couple of weeks now... at
                                  first I thought it challenged or contradicted
                                  things I'd figured out... and hence, my
                                  chances of being able to manifest... but,
                                  aside from surface appearances I keep finding
                                  deeper connections, a corroboration of what I
                                  figured out in this life...

AV         9/7/01   11:33 AM I just called the keys different things, and
                                  some of them... well all of them, really...
                                  share some of the most important qualities and
                                  characteristics...

AV         9/7/01   11:35 AM do you want to know what I said to my
                                  therapist when I finally broke down in gender
                                  counselling? you should find it very
                                  interesting... as this was about two years
                                  before we met...

Kaori-Chan 9/7/01   11:35 AM *Nods* yes.

AV         9/7/01   11:41 AM I had been trying to tell my therapist that I
                                  was struggling with something much deeper than
                                  just gender... the gender issue was just what
                                  got me started on trying to figure my true
                                  identity out... by that point I knew roughly
                                  who and what I was supposed to be and that SRS
                                  would never allow me to realize any of it... I
                                  had to hope for a miracle because there was no
                                  medical way to, well, you know... 
                                  
                                  at the point where I finally broke down I told
                                  her, in tears and broken wails, that I was
                                  tired of holding the entire world together
                                  with my heart... at the time I knew I was
                                  speaking the literal truth, but... for the
                                  life of me I could not figure out why *I*
                                  would be the "heart" of the world... ::shakes
                                  her head::

Kaori-Chan 9/7/01   11:43 AM I see... what did you think about yourself
                                  saying this after you look back on it?

AV         9/7/01   11:50 AM for a moment I half expected to be struck by
                                  lightening... I knew that I was speaking of a
                                  divine force as if it were my personal
                                  obligation... in this world people who
                                  identify too closely with God are put down,
                                  one way or another... as I said it could look
                                  back through my life and see that I've always
                                  felt that way... I've always been highly
                                  empathic... sometimes to the point of being
                                  telepathic... I had to learn how to control
                                  emotions in order to seperate myself from the
                                  people around me
                                  
                                  for a long time I've known that there are no
                                  secrets in the universe... only that we tend
                                  to overlook the obvious... I had long since
                                  identified the other keys, the Art, the Soul,
                                  the Mind, the Absolute or the Staff, Sword,
                                  Book and Orb.... I tended to overlook the
                                  Heart
                                  
                                  I kept overlooking it until about the third
                                  time you named the keys... and I finally asked
                                  what the Rose represented... and I realized it
                                  represented a lot... but it was best stated by
                                  saying the Heart

Kaori-Chan 9/7/01   11:52 AM *Nods*  I have taught you much, I suppose.

AV         9/7/01   12:04 PM ::studies you for a moment:: 
                                  sorry that sounded sort of... pompous. I know
                                  you didn't mean it that way... to be honest,
                                  you are a difficult person to learn from
                                  because you have a... well, you speak with the
                                  courage of your convictions, you give the
                                  impression that there is no room for
                                  interpretation in your assertions and yet,
                                  with the written or spoken word there always
                                  has to be room for interpretation, words lack
                                  the authority of the voice
                                  
                                  what I've been learning, really, is that our
                                  ideas, our understanding might not be as much
                                  at odds as I first feared they might be...
                                  it's not a case of, in order for me to be
                                  right you have to be wrong, or vice versa...
                                  the reason this world has so many different
                                  religions is because people hold the language,
                                  culture and assumptions of their beliefs
                                  higher than what they actually believe in... 
                                  
                                  personally, I've never found it that hard to
                                  understand that "God" has more than one set of
                                  clothes

Kaori-Chan 9/7/01   12:11 PM indeed, I proport to the same concept.
                                  
                                  I do not think you sounded pompous, however. 
                                  That is more my job.  ^^;

AV         9/7/01   12:23 PM ah, well. I was referring to the "I have
                                  taught you much" comment... that sort of threw
                                  mw for a moment. ::blushes:: By commenting on
                                  it, I didn't mean to hurt your feelings... it
                                  was just feed back, you know I don't judge you
                                  or overreact to you. 
                                  
                                  getting back to the point... I was having a
                                  hard time accepting your memory of our past
                                  lives... it really irked me to have a history
                                  I didn't know about, but more to have an
                                  entirely different set of beliefs and
                                  paradigms associated with it... my success in
                                  this life really depends on the perfection of
                                  my present understanding... nothing makes me
                                  feel more sick than the thought that I might
                                  have gotten it all wrong...::shudders:: after
                                  spending something like 17 years figuring
                                  things out, I really can't deal with having to
                                  start all over
                                  
                                  fortunately, it doesn't seem that will be
                                  necessary

Kaori-Chan 9/7/01   12:24 PM Our race was a long lived one, and each
                                  generation had to deal with all of the
                                  problems humans had to deal with... but our
                                  long lives tended to help us with perspective
                                  and time to think.

AV         9/7/01   12:30 PM ::nods:: my mind does not remember, but it
                                  seems that my heart does... that or you and I
                                  just think too much alike and our dreams and
                                  delusions (ironic tone, joke joke) just happen
                                  to coincide perfectly
                                  
                                  ::hugs you:: every day it takes is like a
                                  blow... maybe...
                                  
                                  I can understand why the sword was the symbol
                                  of the soul in that world... while it is
                                  considered the symbol of the mind in this
                                  one... the soul is the only true thing forged
                                  in life... in this world there is very little
                                  difference between the soul and the mind, for
                                  neither one is within science's grasp, and
                                  hence are both shoved into a dark corner
                                  together... you could say that in this world,
                                  the only evidence of the mind is that the mind
                                  picks up that sword and weilds it in the dark
                                  shadows of oblivion to survive the demons this
                                  world throws at it...

Kaori-Chan 9/7/01   12:32 PM the difference between the two lies in
                                  spirituality and knowledge....
                                  
                                  I am going to go to lunch now, my love.

                                  ::hugs and kisses you farewell::

Kaori-Chan 9/7/01   12:33 PM You are my everything, Alex.

Kaori-Chan 9/7/01   12:34 PM you bring sanity to my insane existence...

                                  not.

Kaori-Chan 9/7/01   12:35 PM *Kisses you gently, then wanders off.*

AV         9/10/01  9:25 PM  hey you!

Kaori-Chan 9/10/01  9:26 PM  hi.  Been away and all.

AV         9/10/01  9:26 PM  yeah. me too... how you doing?

AV         9/10/01  9:27 PM  ::hugs you:: I suppose the big question at the
                                  moment, do you need to go to bed soon?

Kaori-Chan 9/10/01  9:27 PM  not VERY soon...

AV         9/10/01  9:27 PM  good... ::kisses you::

AV         9/10/01  9:28 PM  I suppose you're RPing somewhere at the
                                  moment?

Kaori-Chan 9/10/01  9:29 PM  nope.

AV         9/10/01  9:29 PM  really? ::laughs:: so, were you just waiting
                                  up to see if I'd come online?

Kaori-Chan 9/10/01  9:30 PM  something like that.  ^^;

AV         9/10/01  9:30 PM  ::smiles and settles into your lap:: well,
                                  that's nice...

AV         9/10/01  9:32 PM  are you tired?

Kaori-Chan 9/10/01  9:32 PM  gimme a couple minutes.  ^^;

AV         9/10/01  9:33 PM  okay... ::musses your hair and leans against
                                  you::

Kaori-Chan 9/10/01  9:34 PM  you wanna RP with me, Alex?

AV         9/10/01  9:35 PM  ::smiles:: of course, the only question is do
                                  you have time? I don't want to keep you up and
                                  screw up anything at school for you

Kaori-Chan 9/10/01  9:36 PM  I got plenty of time.  ^>^  My classes don't
                                  start till 3pm

AV         9/10/01  9:37 PM  ::nods:: that's true... alright, what did you
                                  have in mind?

Kaori-Chan 9/10/01  9:39 PM  continue that one we were doing?

AV         9/10/01  9:42 PM  right, Simon, and my character was Elizabeth,
                                  right?

Kaori-Chan 9/10/01  9:43 PM  Kate.

AV         9/10/01  9:44 PM  oh... der! sorry, sometimes I have swiss
                                  cheese memory, especially for names... I'm
                                  looking for the logs, we played in #Innocence!
                                  and in #DragonPhoenix, right?

Kaori-Chan 9/10/01  9:44 PM  I'm in Starchat.  The other three chars were
                                  Lisa, Ami, and Paul.

Kaori-Chan 9/10/01  9:44 PM  just in #Innocence! though I said some stuff
                                  about the chars in DP.

AV         9/10/01  9:45 PM  okay... I have to glance at the logs a minute
                                  first... for whatever reason I can never look
                                  at them while I am in the channels... annoying

AV         9/10/01  9:49 PM  do you have that problem? or do you know of a
                                  way around it?

Kaori-Chan 9/10/01  9:49 PM  never have that problem... i just open it up
                                  from inside the program, the thing opens, it
                                  has the current logs and a long list of
                                  previous logs.  why not try opening them first
                                  them going into IRC?

AV         9/10/01  9:50 PM  okay... worth a shot

AV         9/11/01  1:00 AM  hey you... saw you got pinged out... are you
                                  coming back?

Kaori-Chan 9/11/01  1:01 AM  yeah.

AV         9/11/01  1:01 AM  did you get my last posts?

Kaori-Chan 9/11/01  1:01 AM  I got "Clearly it is a symbol of nature
                                  itself"

AV         9/11/01  1:02 AM  <Kaoru-Sama> We are as fire and water... wind
                                  and earth.
                                  <AVmorgan> do you realize how much is implicit
                                  in the symbol of the rose?
                                  <Kaoru-Sama> Not directly, no.  I have not
                                  given much thought to it, at least not in this
                                  life.
                                  <AVmorgan> the common association of the Rose
                                  is as a symbol of emotions... however, that is
                                  merely a thin veneer over the surface of it's
                                  true symbolism
                                  <AVmorgan> within the rose is the symbols of
                                  life contained in any flower... the
                                  unification of the sexes, the concept of birth
                                  and rebirth... the potential of the seed,
                                  making it both a symbol of the beginning and
                                  end of life, for the flower lies not only at
                                  the physical ends of the plant, but
                                  reproduction is the ultimate end of the
                                  plant's existence
                                  <AVmorgan> the close association of the sexes
                                  and reproduction also evokes the very fabric
                                  of life as intercourse, which is sexual at the
                                  heart, and evolves into social intercourse
                                  that weaves together reality itself
                                  <AVmorgan> clearly it is a symbol of nature
                                  itself...
                                  <AVmorgan> it is also... a symbol of the
                                  phoenix
                                  * AVmorgan stares off into the distance...
                                  <AVmorgan> I guess that explains why some
                                  people thought of me as the goddess of sex...

AV         9/12/01  11:25 PM that's fine... I... 
                                  
                                  I am still watching the news reports... this
                                  is having all sorts of strange effects... from
                                  one report I heard, the government of Mexico
                                  uninamously vouted to apply to the United
                                  States for membership as the 51st state... 
                                  
                                  on the emotional side, I am taking it in as
                                  slowly as I can... this is not a time to be
                                  insane with grief and rage... this is not a
                                  time to ask myself if I knew something like
                                  this was coming, though I could not help
                                  asking myself where I'd be now if I had
                                  already fulfilled my promise... as hard as it
                                  is to say, a great thing will come of this
                                  tragedy... something that could not exist if
                                  this tragedy had not occurred.
                                  
                                  Just as America must not allow its spirit to
                                  be crushed by this, individuals like us must
                                  not let this crush our own spirits, our own
                                  hopes and dreams...

AV         9/12/01  11:28 PM I am with you in spirit, though I am only in
                                  and out online and so far away in other
                                  respects... I hold you always in love, I am
                                  here, and I am there with you... I'll check in
                                  with you again in a bit...

Kaori-Chan 9/12/01  11:41 PM I love you a great deal, alex.  I wish I did
                                  not feel so unconcerned about the whole
                                  situation...  perhaps because I haven't been
                                  effected by it yet, none of my family had
                                  connections to NY or the pentagon.

AV         9/12/01  11:51 PM ::holds you close:: soon enough the shock and
                                  disbelief will wear off, and the implications
                                  will settle in... it's hard to know what to
                                  feel when disaster strikes somewhere over the
                                  horizon, and no one can criticize you for
                                  feeling only a vague unease and detachment...
                                  what we've seen on TV is hard to distinguish
                                  from what we're fed in the movies... don't be
                                  ashamed about not feeling it at once
                                  
                                  I admire a man who does not pretend to
                                  feelings which logic dictates a "humane"
                                  person ought to feel... who's to say what
                                  *anyone* should feel at a time like this? No
                                  one can. I love you very much. I am here for
                                  you, whatever you are feeling, and I will be
                                  here to talk to when it does effect you. 

Kaori-Chan 9/12/01  11:56 PM *Nods* I am entertaining a friend right now. 
                                  You take care, and don't worry too much...
                                  life goes on, we're still here.  

AV         9/12/01  11:56 PM Already this has proven to be a lesson to me,
                                  and a hard lesson to learn at that... maybe
                                  I'll be able to put it into words in time...
                                  but right now, I feel rather... sober
                                  
                                  I'll say goodnight for now

Kaori-Chan 9/12/01  11:58 PM *nods* goodnight.  *hugs*

AV         9/12/01  11:59 PM ::hugs you, and kisses you goodnight::

Kaori-Chan 9/13/01  12:04 PM Perhaps I will sound a bit jaded in what I am
                                  about to say, but.... I find it rather
                                  depressing that people believe family involved
                                  in such tragedies must have had a purpose in
                                  their death.  Some babble on about how God
                                  must have wanted this to happen, and talk
                                  about how strong their faith is...
                                  
                                  We are responsible for our own destiny, our
                                  own lives...  God no more masterminds it all
                                  than he guides us by the hand.  The Creator,
                                  the being who made all, does not interfere
                                  with mankind except in certain
                                  circumstances... we are responsible for such
                                  tragedies, such horrific mass-death's.
                                  
                                  and there is no reason or meaning behind it. 
                                  It is death... death is death, and people need
                                  to learn that the only will involved is the
                                  will of man... the Creator is a silent
                                  observer.
                                  
                                  The afterlife is not a "Heaven" or some
                                  blissful paradise, in some sense it might be
                                  better because we are allowed full self
                                  control through force of will, unchained from
                                  our physical bodies... I am not sure what I am
                                  trying to say.

Kaori-Chan 9/13/01  7:32 PM  hellooo... you dere?

AV         9/13/01  8:20 PM  I know I'm a couple of minutes late... hope
                                  you'll be back soon... ::hugs::

Kaori-Chan 9/13/01  8:25 PM  I'm back.

Kaori-Chan 9/13/01  8:25 PM  been an interesting day.

AV         9/13/01  8:31 PM  how so?

Kaori-Chan 9/13/01  8:32 PM  Well, my computer CPU fan is vibrating, and
                                  won't shut up... rattling metal (The venting
                                  section above the CPU) to a certain way which
                                  gives me a headache.
                                  
                                  Danita came back to town, and i guess she's
                                  going out with Herschel, which is great for
                                  her but I dislike not being told some things.

AV         9/13/01  8:39 PM  I sympathize about the fan, mine started
                                  groaning and whining a few weeks back...
                                  ::smiles::
                                  I am surprised Danita didn't talk to you about
                                  that... 

Kaori-Chan 9/13/01  8:39 PM  did she talk to you about it?

AV         9/13/01  8:41 PM  um... it's more like, from what you've said I
                                  now understand what she was really talking
                                  about... I was under the impression she was
                                  talking about you... but for the most part she
                                  was talking about her ex being upset abou ther
                                  going to Fairbanks

Kaori-Chan 9/13/01  8:42 PM  baah, ben???
                                  
                                  Probably not what was meant.  

AV         9/13/01  8:44 PM  well, I don't really know much about who is
                                  who up there... I asked her if she was talking
                                  about you, but she said no, she wasn't... I
                                  wasn't sure though...

AV         9/13/01  8:44 PM  is it Danita that you really wanted to talk
                                  about, or was it just on your mind?

Kaori-Chan 9/13/01  8:45 PM  primarily, I'm sort of upset.  I'm not the
                                  sort to be jealous, and honestly it doesn't
                                  bother me so much, but I wasn't told or even
                                  talked to about it.
                                  
                                  Sometimes I wonder if I have any genuine
                                  friends at all.  =(
                                  
                                  Well... there is Rob, who does put up with my
                                  shit.

AV         9/13/01  8:51 PM  ah, well... here's a question for you... I
                                  know you've talked to Danita... have you
                                  indicated an interest in her? and what sort of
                                  interest did you confide? do you think that
                                  might be enough that, if she was looking for
                                  something entirely in an relationship, it
                                  would make it awkward for her to talk to you
                                  about an interest in someone else?

AV         9/13/01  8:51 PM  entirely different, I meant... 
                                  

Kaori-Chan 9/13/01  8:52 PM  We're friends.  *Shrugs*  I talked to her
                                  about a relationship involving intimacy, but
                                  keeping emotions out of it.
                                  
                                  I'm not upset that she is going out with the
                                  guy, i'm upset I wasn't told.

Kaori-Chan 9/13/01  8:55 PM  specifically, I expressed a sexual interest in
                                  her, but did not want to pursue a romantic
                                  relationship, remaining just friends.
                                  
                                  Likewise before, though, I'm not jealous or
                                  anything, It simply bothers me that I wasn't
                                  told about even the possibility that she might
                                  like this or that person.
                                  
                                  Eh, not important.  I'll get over it in a day
                                  or so... just majorly irritating with the rest
                                  of the day.  ^^;

AV         9/13/01  8:59 PM  I don't know what to say... it doesn't do you
                                  much good to be upset about it, it will only
                                  get in the way of being able to talk to her
                                  about this sort of thing in the future... I
                                  don't know what kind of friendship you two
                                  have, that you feel she ought to have said
                                  something... and I don't think she really had
                                  her mind made up going in... last I talked to
                                  her she was just wondering if anyone would be
                                  hurt if she did try to get to know this other
                                  guy better
                                  
                                  have you talked to her at all lately? I mean,
                                  do you feel she deliberately avoided
                                  mentioning it, or is it you two just haven't
                                  really talked while this was going on?

Kaori-Chan 9/13/01  9:02 PM  *Shrugs* She had the opportunity a couple
                                  times today, I am notoriously oblivious to
                                  obvious things around me... not completely,
                                  but i do have a tendency to ignore minor
                                  details.
                                  
                                  She was in my room by herself for a couple
                                  minutes, said nothing.  I think perhaps it's
                                  more upsetting that i shared some of my sexual
                                  self with her in some discussions, it seems
                                  like she would at least have the courtesy to
                                  tell me she likes this guy.
                                  
                                  She's not really my problem, i'm only mildly
                                  angry at her.  My real problem is i'm very
                                  lonely... thinking about you calms be down
                                  quite a bit, but i am still lonely.

AV         9/13/01  9:05 PM  ::takes you into her arms:: I understand... I
                                  have people around a lot, but I usually feel
                                  pretty lonely... talking to you helps a lot
                                  with the lonliness, but I really miss having
                                  someone to hold onto

Kaori-Chan 9/13/01  9:09 PM  I love you a great deal, Alex... you are very
                                  important to me.  I myself have a lot of
                                  people I hang around and have fun with... 
                                  still, I do return to an empty room, with no
                                  messages on my answering machine (Unless my
                                  parents decide to call).
                                  
                                  I hold onto you...  and I don't feel quite so
                                  lonely.  *Shrugs*  The loneliness is still
                                  there, but it's nowhere near as powerful.

Kaori-Chan 9/13/01  11:13 PM ::Drapes his arms around you tightly::
                                  
                                  We have got to do something about these
                                  problems of ours... 

AV         9/13/01  11:17 PM ::nods:: I worry sometimes that my presence
                                  only aggrivates your problems... to survive
                                  the past 17 years, I really had to learn to be
                                  self sufficient, emotionally... I grew a lot
                                  because I had to in order to survive... in
                                  some ways that made me hard, in some ways that
                                  made me fragile
                                  
                                  sometimes I am afraid that what keeps us apart
                                  is that you need me so much, that I mean so
                                  much to you... does that seem strange to you?

Kaori-Chan 9/13/01  11:18 PM No, I have suggested as much to you on
                                  occassion, that my emotional attachment with
                                  you keeps you from progressing towards your
                                  intended goal.

AV         9/13/01  11:21 PM I think it comes from realizing how much alike
                                  we are... I wonder what path you would have
                                  been destined to follow if you have never met
                                  me... I worry that fulfilling my promise and
                                  going to you would endanger your development,
                                  cheat you of the very lessons I was forced to
                                  learn... but... if that's so, how could we
                                  ever be together?
                                  
                                  does finding me somehow prevent you from
                                  finding yourself?

Kaori-Chan 9/13/01  11:24 PM Alex, I would have to say that is completely
                                  opposite to what has happened since I've met
                                  you.  I am more at ease with myself, and learn
                                  new things... I can be at peace with the
                                  world, and I can grow as a person because I
                                  know your love is genuine and not dependant
                                  upon If's.  It is unconditional and always
                                  present, because I've never had reason to
                                  doubt you.
                                  
                                  Without you, Alex, I would have remained the
                                  same person I always was.... getting kicked
                                  into the ditch, and picking myself back up
                                  again.

AV         9/13/01  11:24 PM I've often noted that most people go through
                                  life and succeed in becoming only half a
                                  person, at best... and I was always committed
                                  to becoming a whole person... and finding a
                                  whole person to share my life with...
                                  
                                  I like to think that I inspire you to be your
                                  best, to become a whole person... I like to
                                  think that meeting was and is a good thing for
                                  both of us

AV         9/13/01  11:27 PM I do know that with you I never have to
                                  pretend... even among friends who insist that
                                  they want nothing more than for me to be
                                  myself, I have to play a part

Kaori-Chan 9/13/01  11:28 PM Even Launce?

AV         9/13/01  11:32 PM even Launce... he does not have any reaction
                                  to my natural personality coming out, but I am
                                  a guy to him, because that's what my anatomy
                                  says... in his opinion the mind has no gender,
                                  and a guy can possess a highly developed
                                  female aspect, but a person is what a person
                                  is

Kaori-Chan 9/13/01  11:33 PM ...
                                  
                                  If one were to have the choice of being shot
                                  in the head, or being disembowelled.... there
                                  really is no choice, dead is dead.  Pain is
                                  pain...
                                  
                                  

AV         9/13/01  11:36 PM I've gone on about how what a person is should
                                  follow who a person is, but he points out that
                                  we choose life, and in choosing to live we
                                  have to accept the circumstances that decision
                                  places us in... if I was supposed to be
                                  female, I would have been born female... in
                                  his mind, there is no legitimacy to the
                                  transsexual phenominon... there is no reason
                                  for a woman to be born in a man's body,
                                  because in this world there is no recognized
                                  way for that woman to change her body, and
                                  wanting to do so is denying reality

Kaori-Chan 9/13/01  11:38 PM There is a perfectly logical reason why a
                                  female soul would be in a male body...
                                  
                                  the journey.
                                  
                                  Each subsequent life is about a journey, a
                                  journey of discovery and development of the
                                  soul.  For him to deny such a thing, or to
                                  ignore such a thing, is to ignore the most
                                  base of tennets to the spiritualistic realms.
                                  
                                  Some of the most balanced, and wise, people in
                                  the world are transsexuals that are post-op.
                                  
                                  What does this say for the rest of society?

AV         9/13/01  11:45 PM that part, the life path, is a deeply
                                  ingrained part of his philosphy and world
                                  view... his arguement is that the lesson of
                                  that particular path is to accept the facts,
                                  to make the best of what you've got, to grow
                                  mentally and emotionally, not to try to change
                                  the body or reality to "get what you want"
                                  
                                  transsexuals and intersexuals have always been
                                  powerful, spiritual and enlightened people...
                                  that's well established in every culture on
                                  earth, at one point in time or another... the
                                  thing with Launce is, he refuses to question
                                  the unknown, he refuses to speculate... from
                                  experience, he knows that there is a lot more
                                  to reality than meets the eye, he does not
                                  deny that there are things in existence which
                                  are mysterious, magical and miraculous, but
                                  argues that those things are not part of this
                                  reality... at this point in time, they are
                                  against the rules... in his opinion, humanity
                                  has not evolved enough to grasp those
                                  mysteries, or else those mysteries are
                                  reserved for life outside of the cycle

AV         9/13/01  11:47 PM well, that's his opinion and he's entitled to
                                  it... if that means that he will not see me
                                  for who I really am, until I can show him fait
                                  accompli, it's hardly the first time I've had
                                  to deal with that

Kaori-Chan 9/13/01  11:48 PM Then Launce, however wonderful he may be,
                                  however successful, is simply a bird trapped
                                  in a guilded cage of his own forging.
                                  
                                  I acknowledge that his views may be correct,
                                  but I also acknowledge that he may be wrong.
                                  
                                  The universe, as it stands, has very few rules
                                  in and of itself... and the only constant rule
                                  which must be obeyed is change.
                                  
                                  The rules change, the world changes, the
                                  universe itself has had paradigm shifts which
                                  altered the fundamental laws of physics to
                                  create the universe we now know of.
                                  
                                  Change is ever constant, and always present...
                                  and mankind is a being of change, to cease to
                                  be, we would die.

AV         9/13/01  11:49 PM what's true in the mind is true

Kaori-Chan 9/13/01  11:50 PM the mind itself can lie.

AV         9/13/01  11:52 PM there in lies the answer to the whole
                                  mystery... the mind is true, and all the
                                  illusions of the mind are built on that
                                  foundation of truth, made true by the faith or
                                  those assumptions... the mind makes things
                                  true, hence, all lies are true... the test of
                                  a truth is, does this thing, whatever it may
                                  be, have an independant truth?
                                  
                                  as it happens, Launce's view is an enlightened
                                  version of the current elite, popular view of
                                  reality... a lot of people live in that same
                                  world, and the rules are the rules they impose
                                  on themselves... if you accept that view, you
                                  accept those rules and that's when those rules
                                  have power

AV         9/13/01  11:53 PM a truth is self defining... autonomous,
                                  absolute... not all things are true, but many
                                  things are dependant upon the truth, and held
                                  in truth to exist

Kaori-Chan 9/13/01  11:53 PM *Nods* We choose to be prisoners or free
                                  beings.

AV         9/13/01  11:53 PM the operative word is "held"

AV         9/13/01  11:53 PM freedom is the power to define your own
                                  prison...

AV         9/13/01  11:54 PM the infinite and the eternal are themselves
                                  prisons

AV         9/13/01  11:54 PM the mind is itself a prison

Kaori-Chan 9/13/01  11:54 PM I like to think of Freedom as the power to be
                                  free of any prisons.  In the truest sense, no
                                  person is free.... but they could be, it is
                                  possible.  It can be reached.

AV         9/13/01  11:54 PM above all things, the soul is a prison

Kaori-Chan 9/13/01  11:54 PM Ahh, the prison of existence.  That is a good
                                  point.

AV         9/13/01  11:55 PM exactly

AV         9/13/01  11:55 PM so, the art is figuring out how to embrace the
                                  true potential of the mind, to make existence
                                  transcend that inescapable quality

AV         9/13/01  11:55 PM the point of life is to *live*

AV         9/13/01  11:56 PM to be awake is to be awakening

Kaori-Chan 9/13/01  11:56 PM so what if one were to awaken while alive?

AV         9/13/01  11:56 PM this is the reason why we are equally capible

AV         9/13/01  11:58 PM people awaken in life all the time, but they
                                  remain trapped in that frame... to be awake is
                                  to be *awakening* a constant process

AV         9/13/01  11:58 PM children possess this quality early in life
                                  and they are gradually subdoes and put to
                                  sleep...

AV         9/13/01  11:58 PM subdued

Kaori-Chan 9/13/01  11:58 PM *Nods* The whole reason we started talking
                                  was.... that you didn't have to pretend to be
                                  someone else for me.

AV         9/13/01  11:59 PM yes

Kaori-Chan 9/13/01  11:59 PM it is because I love YOU unconditionally, I
                                  cannot question you, I simply must believe in
                                  you.

AV         9/14/01  12:00 AM I don't mind if you do question me... but I
                                  bless you and adore you for your faith in
                                  me... ::hugs::

Kaori-Chan 9/14/01  12:01 AM God, I wish there were words that could say
                                  how I feel towards you.  *Sighs* You are
                                  perfect to me, Alex, my one true soulmate...
                                  my second half, my mirror...

AV         9/14/01  12:04 AM ah, but you see... I can't be your second
                                  half... you're a soul in your own right... I
                                  can only be a beacon to lead you into the
                                  embrace of that half of your soul you so
                                  desperately need... a soul mate is like a
                                  twin... another, an equal, and an opposite...
                                  I am your mate, but I cannot claim that half
                                  of your soul... if I give you anything, let it
                                  be that... let it be that

Kaori-Chan 9/14/01  12:06 AM We are two individuals, Alex, but souls can be
                                  incomplete.... individuals can be incomplete.
                                  
                                  Many people take notice at couples who seem to
                                  complete eachother, as if something were
                                  missing prior to their meeting in the person
                                  they knew before.

AV         9/14/01  12:06 AM my love for you and my needs in this life
                                  forced me to develope the second half of my
                                  soul, guided by your inspiration... I am that
                                  for you

AV         9/14/01  12:08 AM because fo what we are, our souls are wide
                                  open to each other, we can lie heart to heart,
                                  mind to mind, fully overlapping because we are
                                  so compatible, but never forget you are meant
                                  to be whole

AV         9/14/01  12:08 AM two as one, two in the space and time of one,
                                  not half and half in one

AV         9/14/01  12:09 AM do you understand?

Kaori-Chan 9/14/01  12:10 AM I suppose... *Hugs* I am going to go now.  I
                                  Love you Alex... I always will love you.

AV         9/14/01  12:11 AM I have always loved you... do not fear, this
                                  is not any form of rejection, it is me trying
                                  to assure you that in the end you won't be
                                  alone

                                  the usual soul searching moments when I strive
                                  to understand what and where I am, and where I
                                  am going from here

Kaori-Chan 9/18/01  2:18 AM  *Nods nods* Have you been making much

                                  or beating yourself up trying to make it work

                                  could write?

AV         9/18/01  2:38 AM  I have gobs of ideas... what's your taste?

Kaori-Chan 9/18/01  2:40 AM  I am not sure, my teacher doesn't want robots
                                  and aliens or the like.  I have a few ideas
                                  myself.

AV         9/18/01  2:42 AM  um... I always hated creative writing
                                  classes... they always seemed to rule out
                                  creativity!

AV         9/18/01  2:43 AM  did they try to limit you to a specific
                                  genre... are they looking for conventional
                                  fiction, or do they allow fantasy or sci-fi
                                  stuff?.

Kaori-Chan 9/18/01  2:45 AM  Oh, I could very well write science fiction OR
                                  Fantasy and still meet his requirements, if he
                                  likes it or not. In fact, I could write it so
                                  expertly that he wouldn't realize it was
                                  science fiction or fantasy till a couple
                                  stories in.

AV         9/18/01  2:46 AM  hmmm... well, what sort of topics have you
                                  been discussing in class? character building,
                                  setting and tone? 

Kaori-Chan 9/18/01  2:47 AM  we have only had one class.  It's a once a
                                  week class.

AV         9/18/01  2:52 AM  ah... well... ::thinks::
                                  
                                  you could do a short peice about a girl who is
                                  exploring the ruins of a castle and encounters
                                  a group of men, among whom is one who will be
                                  her soul mate... their first meeting, in which
                                  only a passing introduction occurs, and in
                                  which some moderate amount of action can occur

AV         9/18/01  2:53 AM  the world we live in has ruined castles, and
                                  bands of young men who prowl about together...

                                  want to

Kaori-Chan 9/18/01  2:55 AM  I'll think about it, I had some other ideas...
                                   ::kisses:: No offense.

AV         9/18/01  2:56 AM  none taken... one of the thing I used to do
                                  was take a snapshot, an image from somewhere
                                  and try to write the story of what is really
                                  going on in that picture...

Kaori-Chan 9/18/01  2:59 AM  *Nod nods*
                                  
                                  I am a writing genius, so I will find ways to

                                  for example, what sort of solid criticism have
                                  you gotten for the style of writing you
                                  experimented with in FC?

Kaori-Chan 9/18/01  3:05 AM  =(
                                  
                                  None of the classes have ever wanted to read
                                  things I've already written.
                                  
                                  The teachers want NEW stuff, aren't interested
                                  in old stuff.

AV         9/18/01  3:07 AM  ah... well... ::smiles:: have you seen the
                                  movie "Finding Forrester"?

Kaori-Chan 9/18/01  3:08 AM  yes, twice.  ^>^

AV         9/18/01  3:09 AM  wonderful movie... when it comes to writing, I
                                  think a talented mentor is worth a thousand
                                  teachers... you won't get such crap from a
                                  mentor... he'll read anything you've written
                                  from the day you were born and try to
                                  challenge it and you... ::sighs:: 

Kaori-Chan 9/18/01  3:14 AM  ?
                                  
                                  You ever have a mentor?

AV         9/18/01  3:16 AM  after a fashion... a big chunk of my mind
                                  distinguished itself for that purpose... 

Kaori-Chan 9/18/01  3:16 AM  but you haven't had someone besides your brain
                                  critique your work?

AV         9/18/01  3:17 AM  nope... ::sighs::

AV         9/18/01  3:18 AM  I've given people stuff to read and critique
                                  quite a bit, including in classes and the
                                  like, and... well, the students all seemed to
                                  admire my writing and the teacher gave me a D

Kaori-Chan 9/18/01  3:19 AM  *Nod nods* It is because... well, there are a
                                  couple things you should tone down, and a few
                                  things you should attempt differently.

AV         9/18/01  3:20 AM  ::smiles:: yes?

Kaori-Chan 9/18/01  3:23 AM  We've spoken about it before, remember?

AV         9/18/01  3:26 AM  ah, well... ::shrugs:: for a minute I thought
                                  you had something new to add ::smiles;:

Kaori-Chan 9/18/01  3:29 AM  What I said before is fairly important, I
                                  would think.  ^>^

AV         9/18/01  3:31 AM  yes, it was... I don't recall the specifics at
                                  the moment, but I remember in general what
                                  you've said, and I agreed with you when I
                                  looked over it all again... 

Kaori-Chan 9/18/01  3:33 AM  *nods* Discovery of flaws is a step towards
                                  improvement.

AV         9/18/01  3:34 AM  ::nods::

AV         9/18/01  3:42 AM  I'm getting tired... are you gonna be up much
                                  longer?

Kaori-Chan 9/18/01  3:42 AM  Just gonna write that story for tonight...
                                  short, not very long.

AV         9/18/01  3:45 AM  okay... I'm a bit frazzled, so I think I'll be
                                  turning in in a few minutes... ::hugs, kiss::

Kaori-Chan 9/18/01  3:46 AM  ::Kisses back lovingly:: I should whip out the
                                  story in about 20 minutes.  ^>^

AV         9/18/01  3:47 AM  cool... wish I could up my typing speed a
                                  bit... it would be nice to be able to keep up
                                  with my thinking enough to just jump into
                                  writing whatever comes to mind... ::smiles::

Kaori-Chan 9/18/01  3:48 AM  ^>^ I guess I type fast enough at times that
                                  everything i'm thinking just comes out
                                  instantaneously.

AV         9/18/01  3:49 AM  ::smiles:: lucky! I know that when I get into
                                  the right frame of mind I can put out rather
                                  impressively... 

Kaori-Chan 9/18/01  3:49 AM  Yeah, I know.  =D

AV         9/18/01  3:50 AM  that's right, you've seem me do it once or
                                  twice, haven't you?

AV         9/19/01  8:06 PM  sorry I missed you... I took a day off from
                                  the computer

AV         9/21/01  12:37 AM I haven't heard from you for a couple of
                                  days... I hope you're alright, love ::hugs::

Kaori-Chan 9/21/01  4:15 AM  fine, just doing things.

Kaori-Chan 9/21/01  7:59 PM  PTHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!

AV         9/21/01  8:00 PM  oh, wow... it looks like you're online...

                                  gently::

Kaori-Chan 9/21/01  8:01 PM  kinda horny...

AV         9/21/01  8:01 PM  oh my! ::bushes... or flushes in delight::

Kaori-Chan 9/21/01  8:02 PM  Want to roleplay with someone since it's been
                                  like a week.

AV         9/21/01  8:02 PM  hmmm... ::considers for a moment::

Kaori-Chan 9/21/01  8:06 PM  where should I mail stuff to you?

AV         9/21/01  8:06 PM  I was supposed to be doing some writing
                                  stuff... I'm not sure I can do that and RP at
                                  the same time... but, what sort of ideas did
                                  you have for RPing tonight?

AV         9/21/01  8:07 PM  oh... um... avmorgan27@home.com that's my main
                                  address for now...

Kaori-Chan 9/21/01  8:07 PM  nevermind.  If you have to write, go write.

AV         9/21/01  8:08 PM  oh, I've been putting it off for a while...
                                  it's so much easier to do the work in my head,
                                  and I have not quite gotten to a point where I
                                  can free write and not paint myself into a
                                  corner... it was more a decision of whether or
                                  not to put it off for the evening... and I
                                  don't mind if we can think of something fun to
                                  do tonight

Kaori-Chan 9/21/01  8:10 PM  true, but I don't want to take away time that
                                  could be more useful to you.

AV         9/21/01  8:13 PM  thanks! that's sweet! still, I can at least
                                  put down some general notes between posts to
                                  keep track of the things I have figured out,
                                  it will make it easier to start writing this
                                  weekend... I'll be honest, I'm not quite in
                                  the mood to pick up Kate's story... although,
                                  I was thinking it would be fun to do a Ranma
                                  and Daijiro with you as Ranma... interested?

Kaori-Chan 9/21/01  8:16 PM  urrr.... not really.  Never played Ranma.

AV         9/21/01  8:17 PM  not interested at all? Really? I'm
                                  surprised... I would have thought you would
                                  like to play him... in any case, I can't think
                                  of anyone better suited to play him than
                                  you... ::shrugs:: 

Kaori-Chan 9/21/01  8:19 PM  I can think of several.  I could play Ranma,
                                  but I just don't usually.

AV         9/21/01  8:23 PM  well... I wanted to do something with Daijiro
                                  the way I originally imagined her... the
                                  original idea involved her being turned into a
                                  boy by the Togenkyo water, and having already
                                  partially reversed it with the nyannichaun,
                                  much to her father's displeasure... this would
                                  be the first meeting, a seperate story line
                                  from the one with Roland, in which it would
                                  seem at first that Dai is just like Ranma

AV         9/21/01  8:24 PM  hmmm... I suppose that might be a bit much to
                                  deal with for an HRP, though...

AV         9/21/01  8:26 PM  ::sighs:: that's the problem with really good
                                  ideas... 

Kaori-Chan 9/21/01  8:27 PM  You don't think in terms of hentai, you think
                                  in terms of serious roleplaying/stories.

AV         9/21/01  8:28 PM  yeah... I can't help it... for me the hentai
                                  is just the high point of a good story...

AV         9/21/01  8:29 PM  um... well... how much have you read of my
                                  story? it's sort of along those lines and the
                                  situation is already established, if you've
                                  read that far...

Kaori-Chan 9/21/01  8:30 PM  If you pay attention to the logs of roland and
                                  I, you could see what sort of things are
                                  preferable.

Kaori-Chan 9/21/01  8:31 PM  Still haven't read much... you can chastise me
                                  if you wish.

AV         9/21/01  8:31 PM  what's the last part you've read?

Kaori-Chan 9/21/01  8:32 PM  don't quite recall, and it depends on what
                                  story you mean.

AV         9/21/01  8:35 PM  to be honest, the first chapter should have
                                  been a complete story on it's own, but...
                                  ::shrugs:: I can fix that later... the one I
                                  am talking about is the one in which "Alex"
                                  inexplicably turns into a girl while rock
                                  jumping with his friends... 
                                  
                                  after that he's taken by his father to meet a
                                  girl he's just become a twin to... somewhat
                                  deliberately, there's a lot of Ranma influence
                                  in that part, but there's a lot more to her
                                  than there ever was to Akane...

Kaori-Chan 9/21/01  8:36 PM  urr, okay.

AV         9/21/01  8:37 PM  Alexander and Alexandrea are both the end
                                  products of a breeding program, and because
                                  they're both the closest to the program's
                                  ideal, his transformation makes him her
                                  twin... I stopped writing it because it became
                                  obvious that the back story is too deep and I
                                  was losing readers in spite of writing some
                                  very interesting scenes

AV         9/21/01  8:38 PM  I am being summoned... be right back...

AV         9/21/01  8:47 PM  wheeee! I'm back...

Kaori-Chan 9/21/01  8:54 PM  kool.  ^>^

AV         9/21/01  8:55 PM  I take it I have to use the MyInfo thingie to
                                  read the Aldur file?

Kaori-Chan 9/21/01  8:56 PM  hai.

AV         9/21/01  8:56 PM  okay... I'll install it tonight before I shut
                                  down...
                                  
                                  now, did you find someone to RP with already?

Kaori-Chan 9/21/01  8:58 PM  roland is doing some stuff with me.

AV         9/21/01  8:59 PM  ah... mind if I ask?

AV         9/23/01  3:20 AM  I'm doind alright... I found another server I

                                  it isn't quite the following as dal.net, but
                                  it's mostly an english and japanese speaking
                                  environment of anime, manga, and online comics
                                  (being MegaTokyo IS one)... so I am meeting
                                  people on irc again...

Kaori-Chan 9/23/01  3:20 AM  aaaah.  ^^;

AV         9/23/01  3:21 AM  ::grins:: are you gonna be up for a bit?

Kaori-Chan 9/23/01  3:21 AM  urr, maybe, y?

AV         9/23/01  3:29 AM  I think I'll be up for an hour... or two...

Kaori-Chan 9/23/01  3:29 AM  k... ::Hugs::

AV         9/23/01  3:30 AM  ::holds you close and kisses your cheek::
                                  anything you feel like talking about tonight?

Kaori-Chan 9/23/01  3:31 AM  Not really... ::Thinks:: Unless you wanna talk
                                  about Fragile Clay or my campaign setting.

AV         9/23/01  3:34 AM  ah... I'll be honest, tonight's not a good
                                  night for those topics... I have reams of plot
                                  and setting for my story chasing around in my
                                  head in preparation for starting writing this
                                  week... I doubt I could shove it aside right
                                  now... 

Kaori-Chan 9/23/01  3:35 AM  *Nod nods*

AV         9/23/01  3:36 AM  well, if you don't want to talk, I'll just
                                  leave the window open and cuddle with you
                                  while we're both on line... ::caresses your

Kaori-Chan 9/23/01  3:52 AM  ::Laughs:: Yes, it is.

AV         9/23/01  3:54 AM  ::laughs with you, settling into your lap::
                                  You know... whatever happens, this can never
                                  be taken away from you... from us... so in a
                                  sense, it can only get better from here!

Kaori-Chan 9/23/01  3:54 AM  *Smiles* You're very positive tonight.

AV         9/23/01  3:56 AM  I am always positive at the core... from time
                                  to time, the tides of life ruffle my
                                  surface... my mind is like a hurricane, but I
                                  am always in the eye... ::she looks you in the
                                  eye, smiling fondly::

Kaori-Chan 9/23/01  4:08 AM  ::Smiles gently back:: Mm... I do so love you,
                                  Alex.  

AV         9/23/01  4:09 AM  "The greatest thing... you'll ever learn... is
                                  just to love... and BE loved in return"
                                  
                                  I am glad I share that with you...

Kaori-Chan 9/23/01  4:13 AM  *Smiles, simply holding you close*

Kaori-Chan 9/23/01  4:21 AM  I'm going to go, hon... ::Kisses you deeply::
                                  Keep that positive attitude.  ::Smiles gently,

                                  with you tonight... I think I am getting a
                                  better grip on this... ::returns your kiss

Kaori-Chan 9/23/01  4:23 AM  ::Smiles:: I always will, Alex... even in
                                  waking, a part of me dreams of you always.

                                  tight::

Kaori-Chan 9/26/01  11:05 PM kinda tired and all... Didn't sleep all day
                                  since yesterday, I fell unconcious while
                                  watching the premiere of the new Trek series
                                  and woke up around 9:30.
                                  
                                  

AV         9/26/01  11:06 PM wOw... ::sigh:: we don't get UPN, so I can't
                                  watch it... what were you doing up so long?

Kaori-Chan 9/26/01  11:12 PM writing a paper.  Either my teacher will be
                                  furious that I poked fun at his methods, or
                                  he'll laugh...  depends on if he can laugh at
                                  himself.
                                  
                                  

AV         9/26/01  11:13 PM oh, that is so you... I hope he has a sense of
                                  humor! Unless you went out of your way to be
                                  insulting, I am sure there's nothing for him
                                  to get upset over, really...

Kaori-Chan 9/26/01  11:13 PM you wanna read?

AV         9/26/01  11:14 PM um... how long is it? I'm in the middle of
                                  writing something...

Kaori-Chan 9/26/01  11:14 PM 6 pages (12 D. Spaced)

AV         9/26/01  11:15 PM um... if you wanna email it to me, I'll read
                                  it as soon as I am done... um, actually you'd
                                  have to email it to me anyway, for some reason
                                  I can't receive via icq

Kaori-Chan 9/26/01  11:16 PM I'm behind a firewall.

AV         9/26/01  11:17 PM I'm behind a cheap ass fire wall... a NAT
                                  box... it's the same thing that keeps me from
                                  getting on dal.net...

Kaori-Chan 9/26/01  11:17 PM ::Nodnods::

AV         9/26/01  11:21 PM ::grins:: so, it's been a few days... keeping
                                  your chin up? 

Kaori-Chan 9/26/01  11:22 PM yah, a little hectic around here, but nothing
                                  I can't handle.  ^^;

AV         9/26/01  11:25 PM I've missed you... but at the same time, it's
                                  forced me to put more effort into my writing
                                  to keep myself occupied and productive...
                                  how's that for a back-handed compliment?
                                  ::laughing::
                                  
                                  now if only I could get more done! I haven't
                                  hit my stride yet... I can work on the big
                                  picture but the actual scenes are coming too
                                  fast and furious to write down! 

Kaori-Chan 9/26/01  11:25 PM so write down what you can and come back later
                                  to flesh them out.  shorthand is incedibly
                                  useful.

AV         9/26/01  11:30 PM yeah... as long as you don't end up with too
                                  much of it... one book attempt, I had the
                                  whole thing drafted out in condensed form, and
                                  it was about 200 pages worth of writing... it
                                  was too much to tackle when I wanted to flesh
                                  out parts... I didn't flesh it out enough and
                                  so it remained way to condensed even after the
                                  second revision... that first chapter you
                                  read... you remember how dense that was?
                                  aaaarrrrrghhh!

Kaori-Chan 9/26/01  11:31 PM ::Nods Nods::  Just take it easy hon. 
                                  ::Kisses::

AV         9/26/01  11:34 PM I will... I've got a handle on what I want to
                                  do with this story, and when I start to feel
                                  frustrated, I just get up and go away for a
                                  bit... it helps to stop and come back to it
                                  when my mind is settled...

Kaori-Chan 9/26/01  11:37 PM ::Snuggles against you::

Kaori-Chan 9/27/01  12:17 AM quite alright.  ^>^

AV         9/27/01  12:19 AM heh heh heh... well, for now it appears that
                                  I've pinned down the course of the series...
                                  and this time it doesn't turn into Rose's life
                                  story! I don't mind taking inspiration from a
                                  dimly half remembered life, but it's not the
                                  story I am supposed to be writing... ::smiles
                                  and tilts her head::

Kaori-Chan 9/27/01  12:32 AM gonna sleep now, sweety.

                                  you.  *Kisses and hugs tightly*

                                  I think only that it is peaceful in my soul
                                  knowing that I have you.

AV         10/6/01  10:26 PM I was just playing with you, I know that you
                                  generally have more on your mind than sex... I
                                  was just trying to amuse you... I know that I
                                  must present you with more than a few things
                                  to think about, and I wonder where your
                                  thoughts take you when those things come up...
                                  
                                  whenever I think of you I get a bit
                                  impatient... I think I am a strong enough
                                  person to survive even if I remained trapped
                                  like this for the rest of my life... it would
                                  be limiting, but it can't really prevent me
                                  from being myself... but it does interfere
                                  with relationships! 

Kaori-Chan 10/6/01  10:27 PM *Nods* It's true, but it'll happen... I know
                                  it.  ^>^

AV         10/6/01  10:30 PM what about yourself? with all the big changes
                                  I have to make in my life, do you see anything
                                  similar in your life? did you ever feel that
                                  you're sort of living in a rental? did you
                                  ever have a sense that you have a unique or
                                  ideal self image you felt compelled to
                                  realize?

Kaori-Chan 10/6/01  10:31 PM of course....  ^>^  Didn't I say I wanted to
                                  be your twin?

AV         10/6/01  10:38 PM it came up in conversation, but I was not sure
                                  what the motivation was... I mean, there is a
                                  lot of stuff in my writing where the hero
                                  meets the heroine and sees his true self in
                                  her... and I know that all of the things I've
                                  figured out indicate that my soul mate is as
                                  much my soul twin... I don't really feel that
                                  I am defined by male or female... I am defined
                                  in myself and understanding myself is what
                                  tells me that I am best embodied in the female
                                  form (choosing between male and female) and
                                  perfectly embodied in a female form that
                                  incorporates male attributes... I know you
                                  don't define yourself as a man, you're as
                                  flexible as I am in sex and gender... and I
                                  know that you went through the same sort of
                                  things I did... 
                                  
                                  being my twin is not so much you being a
                                  reflection of me... as you told me, Rose was
                                  and is a big influence on your self image...
                                  
                                  ::pauses:: whoa, thinking out loud... er, in
                                  print...

Kaori-Chan 10/6/01  10:39 PM no, please go on.  I don't mind.

AV         10/6/01  10:39 PM the funny thing is, the story I am working on
                                  still... STIL... seems to revolve around this
                                  theme... twins and lovers...

AV         10/6/01  10:41 PM mmm... did I ever tell you the specifics of
                                  how the "third" sex appears and functions?

Kaori-Chan 10/6/01  10:41 PM no, not really.  ^^;

AV         10/6/01  10:43 PM ::thinks for a moment::

Kaori-Chan 10/6/01  10:44 PM ::Cuddles against you as you think::

AV         10/6/01  10:45 PM hmmm... I cna't think of where I might have
                                  written it down already... so, I'll just spell
                                  it out from memory...

AV         10/6/01  10:58 PM originally I called it the androgyne sex, but
                                  of late I've been calling it the ambi sex... a
                                  single sex that can be used both ways...
                                  
                                  an ambi has the basic frame and proportions of
                                  a female, which allows an ambi to pass as one
                                  and use the pronouns she, her, etc... people
                                  would never stoop to adopting  a third set of
                                  gender pronouns, and an ambi is not an "it"! 
                                  Unlike a hermaphrodite, an ambi has neither
                                  male nor female genitalia... ambi's have their
                                  own unique genitalia which, for the most part,
                                  are internal
                                  
                                  the primary organ is equivalent to both the
                                  penis and the uterus... it rests in a throat
                                  similar to and deeper than a vagina, because
                                  it envelopes and attaches to the back of the
                                  primary organ... I haven't settled on a name
                                  for it, sorry... the reproductive glands
                                  produce ova, and something akin to sperm
                                  
                                  they normally rest near the root of the
                                  primary organ, wreathed by something akin to
                                  fallopean tubes attached to the root... the
                                  gonads and the primary organ can thrust out of
                                  the body cavity.. the primary organ pushes out
                                  through the "vaginal opening" turning it
                                  inside out as it does so, forming the shaft of
                                  the primary organ in it's penetrating
                                  aspect... the gonads push out over the pubic
                                  arch, and slip down into the labia, which
                                  expand like a split scrotu...

AV         10/6/01  10:58 PM scrotum... 'scuse me...

AV         10/6/01  10:59 PM this is necessaary so that the "sperm" can
                                  mature...

Kaori-Chan 10/6/01  11:01 PM very interesting, it sounds similar to
                                  something I read in a story once.
                                  
                                  I take it acting as a female partner is also
                                  effective in the reproductive sense?

AV         10/6/01  11:07 PM yes... when the gonads reside in the body,
                                  they don't produce viable seed, only the
                                  monthly release of ova... the primary organ is
                                  a hollow muscular tube, when relaxed it balls
                                  up creating a chamber lined with endometrial
                                  tissue... within the muscle are individual
                                  threads, all bunched in specific groups, that
                                  can fill with blood when the organ stretches
                                  out lengthwise... like a tongue that can get
                                  rigid
                                  
                                  an ambi usually has a slightly more developed
                                  physique than a female, and her breasts
                                  develop only during pregnancy, shrinking after
                                  the baby has been weaned... because ambi's
                                  were envisioned as a totally unisexual race,
                                  so they had to be unhindered by unsupported
                                  masses on the outside of their bodies...

Kaori-Chan 10/6/01  11:09 PM *Nodnods* Very fascinating, you have put a
                                  great deal of thought and research into this. 
                                  ^>^

AV         10/6/01  11:09 PM an ambi has a normal X chromosome, which is
                                  essentially from her mother, and an exotic X
                                  chromosome that comes from another ambi... the
                                  normal X is only passed on to the ova, while
                                  the exotic X is only passed on to the seed...

AV         10/6/01  11:10 PM the funny thing is... the whole thing came to
                                  me at once... something that was worked out in
                                  the back of my mind, and I've had to spend a
                                  lot of time trying to figure out how it works
                                  and put it into words...

Kaori-Chan 10/6/01  11:10 PM very cool.. so, when pregnant, unless by
                                  another Ambi the child is of a normal
                                  gender(?)

AV         10/6/01  11:13 PM if an ambi mates with a man, she can produce
                                  male and female children... when she mates
                                  with a woman, she can only produce female or
                                  ambi children... in ova production, only 1 out
                                  of 4 gamete cells produced becomes an ova...
                                  that leaves 3 which can mature as seed... 2
                                  exotic X, 1 normal X... the same thing if she
                                  mates with an ambi

AV         10/6/01  11:14 PM also, an ambi is capible of parthenogenesis...
                                  

Kaori-Chan 10/6/01  11:15 PM Parthenogenesis? You mean self impregnation?

AV         10/6/01  11:23 PM actually, the time it takes for the seed to
                                  mature is more than long enough to shut down
                                  ova production... so it's not quite as simple
                                  as producing both seed and ova... an ambi
                                  impregnates herself through self conception...
                                  during ova production, there is a stage where
                                  there are simply two cells with complete
                                  copies of her genetic make up... if she can
                                  access the right biochemical or psionic
                                  trigger and prevent the recombination stage of
                                  meiosis, she can cause those two cells to
                                  become stem ova... as happens with most
                                  humans, one twin often does not come to
                                  term...
                                  
                                  in most cases, though, parthenogenesis occurs
                                  only in individuals with psychic ability, and
                                  individuals with sufficient ability can
                                  actually tie their own soul and mind into the
                                  developing fetus, and create a daughter
                                  self... granting ambi's a form of immortality

Kaori-Chan 10/6/01  11:24 PM aah.... hmm.
                                  
                                  All of these details seem to be a bit more
                                  than just imagination.

AV         10/6/01  11:26 PM ambi's "vagina's" are deep, as I mentioned...
                                  deep enough that at a comparible extension to
                                  avarage penis length (6 to 7 1/2 inches) she
                                  still has enough depth to accommodate about 8
                                  inches... hence, ambi's can penetrate each
                                  other at the same time...
                                  
                                  so, apart from not having breasts... well...
                                  larger than A cup for the most part, they have
                                  everything a woman does, plus a whole lot
                                  more...

Kaori-Chan 10/6/01  11:27 PM they sound beautiful... this is what you want
                                  to be, mm?? I wouldn't mind being one at all.

AV         10/6/01  11:29 PM um... I like to think that this is more than
                                  just something I imagined... I think this is
                                  what I came up with when I delved to the very
                                  heart of my true self image... 
                                  
                                  I think the associated "race" was that of
                                  angels and demons... or gods... ::grins::
                                  in any case, this is the sex of the damned and
                                  divine in my stories...
                                  the sex my character has to deal with becoming
                                  when she merges with her soul mate
                                  
                                  um... yeah...

Kaori-Chan 10/6/01  11:30 PM ::Kisses:: I would love to be your twin as
                                  such a being.

AV         10/6/01  11:31 PM somehow, I thought you'd like it... ::kisses
                                  back:: and I certainly would not object...

Kaori-Chan 10/6/01  11:32 PM Argh, now you've made ME impatient.  ^^;
                                  
                                  I want to be like that, it sounds like a
                                  beautiful gender to be.

AV         10/6/01  11:33 PM True, true... ::hugs::

AV         10/6/01  11:34 PM there is one possible advantage to this being
                                  something *I* dreamed up, though...
                                  
                                  ... that makes this my gift to Creation
                                  ...my *own* creation

Kaori-Chan 10/6/01  11:34 PM ????
                                  
                                  What do you mean?

AV         10/6/01  11:34 PM however, if you really *look* at a rose...
                                  well, you can certainly see the inspiration,
                                  now can't you?

Kaori-Chan 10/6/01  11:35 PM *Blinks, looks confusled*

AV         10/6/01  11:36 PM well, if God (however you want to personify
                                  the Absolute) created Man and Woman... Male
                                  and Female...
                                  ...*I* created Avon (what I named the race...
                                  it stands for the embodiment of change, or
                                  rebirth)

AV         10/6/01  11:37 PM the alternative... so to speak, to being half
                                  of a human being

Kaori-Chan 10/6/01  11:38 PM *Nod nods, kisses you*  I love you, Alex...
                                  and can't wait to be your twin.  ^>^

AV         10/6/01  11:39 PM ::wraps her arms around you and squeezes, her
                                  lips massaging yours:: mmm.... wonderful...
                                  
                                  may I ask though...

AV         10/6/01  11:40 PM ... what sort of feeling do you have at the
                                  thought of living in this world as something
                                  *unique* or even *alien* to everyone else?

AV         10/6/01  11:41 PM I mean, an ambi can pass for female in public,
                                  but in private... especially with a woman...
                                  or a doctor... you'd end up exposing your
                                  difference... how does that make you feel?

Kaori-Chan 10/6/01  11:42 PM *Shrugs* I don't much care what others might
                                  think of my reproductive anatomy.  It's my
                                  business, not theirs.

AV         10/6/01  11:45 PM ::tilts her ehad and smiles:: fair enough...
                                  after all, there are exceptions in the world
                                  already, intersexes... this sort of goes way
                                  beyond that, since an ambi can be a mother and
                                  a father... and...
                                  
                                  ::grins:: an ambi can mate with anyone... and
                                  to a degree, control her own fertility...
                                  depending on the sex of the partner she spends
                                  most of her time with

Kaori-Chan 10/6/01  11:45 PM ^^;;; I hope you do not mind, but the concept
                                  arouses me.

AV         10/6/01  11:47 PM not at all... I had sort of the same reaction
                                  to it when I first discovered it
                                  
                                  oh, there is one thing I forgot to mention...
                                  the parthenogenic part of her reproduction...
                                  um... creates a period in her reproductive
                                  cycle where she essentially goes into heat...
                                  should not forget to mention it...

Kaori-Chan 10/6/01  11:48 PM could you explain that?

AV         10/6/01  11:53 PM in preparation for self conception, her normal
                                  reproductive functions shut down, so she
                                  becomes sterile for normal conception and
                                  fertile for self conception... it lasts for
                                  one to three months a year, during which time
                                  she is in a highly aroused state... in some
                                  cases she will be subject to irregular sleep
                                  patterns, sort of living on the edges of a
                                  dream state, making it easy for her to slip
                                  into a light sleep, but one that lasts from a
                                  few minutes to a few hours...
                                  nymphonarcolepsy, I once called it... this is
                                  the biological pressure for the ambi to tap
                                  into her psi potential and trigger a self
                                  conception... in some cases, this state does
                                  not end until self conception occurs... it's
                                  sort of a rite of passage from
                                  childhood/adolescence to adulthood... so it
                                  becomes most pronounced at around age 17...

Kaori-Chan 10/6/01  11:54 PM So All Avons self impregnate at age 17?

AV         10/7/01  12:01 AM it's part of the evolutionary mechanism... the
                                  body essentially tests itself before entering
                                  the mating stage... a healthy avon will bear a
                                  child during her first heat, establishing the
                                  existence of sufficient psi potential, genetic
                                  design sufficient for the individual to have
                                  survived childhood, and anotomic design
                                  sufficient for bearing young to term... in an
                                  avon society, children are taught to master
                                  their psi potential so that they can conceive
                                  a daughter self, which protects them from
                                  accidental death (they have a back up body)
                                  and because the presence of a daughter self
                                  helps mute the demands of heat in the
                                  future... however, some use that potential to
                                  avoid self conception, since heat is an innate
                                  form of contraception, and for some reason it
                                  has rejuvenating and regenerative properties
                                  for the body... so, an ambi can remain young
                                  and active for decades mastering a trade...
                                  there are no men in an avon society, so there
                                  are those who have to put off having children
                                  to serve as the hunters, warriors, and masters
                                  of crafts and trades...

Kaori-Chan 10/7/01  12:02 AM :Nibbles on your neck:: The very idea of a
                                  society like this is arousing... ::Blushes::

AV         10/7/01  12:04 AM Avon who choose to conceive a daughter-self
                                  are said to be following the Phoenix Path, and
                                  those who endure the longevity of heat are
                                  said to be following the Dragon Path... but,
                                  the smart ones devote their daughter self to
                                  the Dragon Path, there by gaining the
                                  experience and wisdom of both paths...

AV         10/7/01  12:04 AM ::grins and sighs in pleasure:: I am glad you
                                  like it!

Kaori-Chan 10/7/01  12:06 AM ::Gently nips along your nape, hands stroking
                                  your hips:: mm... do Avon's typically have
                                  Avon mates?

AV         10/7/01  12:16 AM Avon are not particularly possessive or
                                  jealous... they are not dependant, like men,
                                  on mates for preserving their genes or
                                  lineage... due to the rebirth factor, new
                                  births are somewhat rare... they generally
                                  result only from a coupling between two avon
                                  in love, which though the ideal is rare...
                                  avon are more inclined to an avon mate, but
                                  they tend to find men very attractive...
                                  whereas women tend to find avon exceptionally
                                  attractive... obviously, women can sometimes
                                  occur in an entirely avon society, so they are
                                  usually seen as rare, and precious
                                  individuals... avon-avon couples are the most
                                  common, ollowed by man-woman-avon triads...
                                  followed by man-avon, then woman-avon...

Kaori-Chan 10/7/01  12:18 AM ::Kisses along your neck, hands drifting up to
                                  rub across your midriff.::

AV         10/7/01  12:18 AM the reason woman-avon couples are the most
                                  rare is because avon see women as both special
                                  and more vulnerable... so they always allow
                                  the woman to choose and define the
                                  relationships

AV         10/7/01  12:26 AM the funniest thing with avon is what happens
                                  when they first encounter men and women...
                                  their first assumption is that every woman is
                                  pregnant or a recent mother, because they all
                                  have breasts... they think the men need to
                                  lighten up and learn to work together because
                                  they all seem to have become muscle bound and
                                  overdeveloped, totally ruining their looks...
                                  then they realize that all the men prefer the
                                  "young mothers" always chasing after the
                                  people with big breasts, and wonder why they
                                  can't give the poor women a break... to them,
                                  it's an avon society that's way out of
                                  balance, with mothers doomed to bear child
                                  after child after child... after a bit, the
                                  concept of seperate sexes finally penetrates
                                  and then they begin to develope breast envy...
                                  since at full extension, an avon is easily 12
                                  to 14 inches in length, they rarely suffer
                                  from penis envy... it takes a while for their
                                  male lovers to get used to seeing a "girl" who
                                  is hung like a horse... ::giggles::

Kaori-Chan 10/7/01  12:27 AM ::Smiles, stroking your tummy::

AV         10/7/01  12:30 AM an avon is also capible of penetrating a
                                  partner when her organ is flacid... because it
                                  is primarily a muscle, a flacid organ is like
                                  a tongue, and it's very agile... lovers will
                                  often sleep with these "tongues" wrapped
                                  around and tucked inside of each other...

Kaori-Chan 10/7/01  12:31 AM Is this how you see yourself in your mind?

AV         10/7/01  12:31 AM it goes way beyond holding hands, I know! it
                                  also means that avon can engage in coital acts
                                  in the strangest of positions, or even in
                                  public...

AV         10/7/01  12:32 AM I either seem myself like this, or I see
                                  myself as female with a man always hovering
                                  near, touching me...

Kaori-Chan 10/7/01  12:33 AM I wouldn't mind being an Avon with you... full
                                  Avon.

AV         10/7/01  12:33 AM wai!!!

Kaori-Chan 10/7/01  12:34 AM ::Smiles:: What's that for?

AV         10/7/01  12:34 AM expressing joy and excitement, of course
                                  ::smiles at you::

Kaori-Chan 10/7/01  12:35 AM ::Kisses you deeply, tasting your mouth.  His

                                  kisses back, wrapping her legs around you::

                                  to stroke gently one breast::

AV         10/7/01  12:42 AM mmm... did I ever tell you about writing a
                                  story similar to Ranma 1/2, before Ranma 1/2
                                  came out?

Kaori-Chan 10/7/01  12:42 AM Hai, I think you did.  ^>^, why do you ask?

AV         10/7/01  12:44 AM the main character was the first "avon"
                                  character I tried to write... er, well, she
                                  was an avatar of myself, of course... but I
                                  had not figured out how her sex worked... it
                                  was more the foundation for the situation she
                                  grew up with...

AV         10/7/01  12:45 AM as a chld, everyone assumed she was a girl...
                                  and because of what she really was, she was
                                  something of a tomboy... she grew up
                                  pretending to be a boy and a girl, and she was
                                  so androgynous that she was able to pull it
                                  off, since she traveled with her father, and
                                  seldom saw the same people for long...

Kaori-Chan 10/7/01  12:45 AM k.

AV         10/7/01  12:48 AM when she hit puberty, it became apparent that
                                  she was not a boy or a girl, so her father
                                  acquired a set of magic rings, which were used
                                  by lovers to swap sexes... one ring would turn
                                  a person male and the other ring would turn a
                                  person female... she wore both rings... and it
                                  turned out that they were cursed... once she
                                  put them on, she couldn't get rid of them...
                                  so, she would flip back and forth between male
                                  and female, whenever a ring was triggered...
                                  she could sort of control them, but she
                                  couldn't quite control herself... the rings
                                  were powered by her, and whenever something
                                  shocked or stunned her, or whenever she got
                                  particularly excited or aroused, she'd
                                  accidentally trigger them

Kaori-Chan 10/7/01  12:49 AM sounds a little like Kaoru.

AV         10/7/01  12:51 AM ::chuckles:: one time, when she was
                                  particularly frustrated, she triggered them at
                                  the same time and was split into male and
                                  female version of herself... after trying to
                                  figure out how to undo it, she eventually
                                  discovered the only way to become one person
                                  was to get rid of the rings and then have sex
                                  with herself, which would allow the two halves
                                  to merge back into an avon

Kaori-Chan 10/7/01  12:52 AM k.  ^^;

AV         10/7/01  12:54 AM I am using a variation of that story in my
                                  current project... except that the main
                                  character was born split, and merges with her
                                  male half after they find the rings, spend a
                                  year trading places, break the curse, and then
                                  merge into an avon the first time they have
                                  unprotected sex... 

Kaori-Chan 10/7/01  12:55 AM k.  Sounds interesting, will it sell? ^^;

AV         10/7/01  1:02 AM  well, I am starting the story after the whole
                                  ordeal of the rings, which I'll do as an a
                                  collection of serial short stories... in the
                                  book, the two have just turned seventeen and
                                  been chosen the paladins of the god and
                                  goddess, and are seperated... the next time
                                  they meet, they are on opposite sides of a
                                  war... he captures her, they become involved
                                  in the summoning of demon that embodies the
                                  destructive aspect of the phoenix... while she
                                  is a prisoner, they make up and end up
                                  sleeping together... that's when they merge,
                                  and become the paladin of the phoenix... 
                                  
                                  there is a point in here that I need to
                                  resolve... in one version of the notes. Dusk
                                  and Dawn are essentially you and me, twin
                                  souls, soul mates... and then they merge, it's
                                  more like they warp through each other and
                                  emerge as twin avon, who later merge again and
                                  conceive the phoenix trinity... the only
                                  problem is, if I use you for the inspiration,
                                  it doesn't quite work, since you're more like
                                  the avatar of the dragon...
                                  
                                  the version I am working on now involved the
                                  merging into one, and then... 

AV         10/7/01  1:02 AM  I need to explain dragon and phoenix
                                  initiation here first... hold on while I copy
                                  those notes...

AV         10/7/01  1:06 AM  A dragon initiation involves an unconscious
                                  rapport between the dragon and the initiate,
                                  in which the dragon potential of the initiate
                                  is evoked and integrated into a projection,
                                  the dragon embodiment of the blooding ritual.
                                  The dragon sustains the initiate through the
                                  transition to the dragon state at the end of
                                  the ritual, when the initiate's body has been
                                  devoured. Initiation by a dragon-born
                                  typically results in a twinning of the
                                  initiate, since the dragon undertakes the
                                  initiation for the purpose of gaining a human
                                  form. 
                                  
                                  What happened on the Eve of Paradox, between
                                  Phoenix and Ash, was a combination of dragon
                                  initiation and phoenix initiation. In the
                                  dragon initiation of a phoenix, the projection
                                  used in a dragon initiation acted as a cross
                                  platform for a dual initiation. The fatal
                                  conclusion of the dragon initiation, allows
                                  the phoenix to slip free of the initiation, by
                                  way of resurrection. However, having been
                                  devoured, the projection was seized in a
                                  phoenix initiation. The blooded dragon was
                                  consumed in the flamed of the phoenix, and
                                  reborn as a twin to that phoenix, granting the
                                  dragon aspect of the projection the
                                  independence of a phoenix,. As the dragon
                                  projection sustained the slain initiate
                                  through the transition to the dragon state,
                                  the phoenix was also twinned in the pyre. In
                                  order for the dual initiation to be fully
                                  resolved, the initiated dragon and phoenix had
                                  to return to and merged with the original
                                  dragon and phoenix, allowing them to
                                  incorporate the newly awakened potentials.

AV         10/7/01  1:08 AM  the character Ash had always been there, as an
                                  avatar of the Dragon and a potential love
                                  interest for Dawn, and later Phoenix (the
                                  union of Dusk and Dawn)...

Kaori-Chan 10/7/01  1:09 AM  heehee... it's alright.  ^>^

AV         10/7/01  1:10 AM  those are really condensed notes... those are
                                  to keep me straight on what is happening
                                  behind the scenes... the readers aren't going
                                  to have to read that... they will just see
                                  what is happening... the explanation will be
                                  hinted in bits and peices over a couple of
                                  books...

Kaori-Chan 10/7/01  1:11 AM  kay, that would be a good idea.  ^>^

AV         10/7/01  1:12 AM  the point is, the version I am working on, the
                                  Phoenix avatar is born split into a boy and a
                                  girl, and when they merge, she begins to
                                  discover what she is... the Dragon avatar
                                  plays a part in setting her up to conceive of
                                  herself as the goddess of that sphere...

AV         10/7/01  1:13 AM  in the process, he becomes the god of that
                                  sphere, her... well, her soul mate

AV         10/7/01  2:41 AM  O... kk... have fun...

Kaori-Chan 10/7/01  2:41 AM  ::Snuggles up next to you:: I wanna RP wif you
                                  some time.

AV         10/7/01  2:44 AM  mmm... we'll see... have to figure out some
                                  way to avoid the long debate I keep starting
                                  when you bring it up! I'll think a bit about a
                                  character that I can use... I know it drives
                                  you nutz for me to play an avatar...

Kaori-Chan 10/7/01  2:44 AM  ^^;;;

AV         10/7/01  2:44 AM  ::bursts out laughing::

AV         10/7/01  2:47 AM  don't sweat... I'll come up with a
                                  character... it's best if I come up with
                                  something before the subject comes up... we
                                  can work on the timing for RPing together...

Kaori-Chan 10/7/01  2:47 AM  Think of anime characters you like, I am sure
                                  you have some you enjoy other than gender
                                  benders which you latch onto for obvious
                                  reasons.  ^^;

AV         10/7/01  2:49 AM  Well! Think about it... I've got it on the
                                  brain, but I *never* get to *play* any! it's
                                  really frustrating... what's the point of
                                  Hentai RP if you can't play with your fantasy?
                                  seriously?

AV         10/7/01  2:58 AM  as for anime characters... every day I find
                                  out how much anime I have never seen... I only
                                  know a few series all that well... Ranma,
                                  Tenchi, OMG, Dirty Pair (and I prefer the Adam
                                  Warren version), Sol Bianca, Bubble Gum
                                  Crisis, Appleseed, Orion, Ghost in the Shell
                                  (I LOVE Masamune Shiro!), Akira... wow,
                                  wouldn't Akira Hentai be really strange!?
                                  
                                  ::shakes her head::
                                  What do you think?

AV         10/7/01  2:59 AM  I havent seen or read Neon Genesis
                                  Evangelion... but I've been hooked by a lot of
                                  fan fiction related to it...

Kaori-Chan 10/7/01  2:59 AM  Golden Boy, Card Captor Sakura, Saber

AV         10/7/01  3:00 AM  yep... never heard of them... ::sighs::

AV         10/7/01  3:01 AM  there was a series I loved that most people
                                  don't know about... Here Is Greenwood... it's
                                  about a bunch of guys in a college dorm... 

Kaori-Chan 10/7/01  3:02 AM  hehehe, I know of it but nothing about it.

AV         10/7/01  3:03 AM  I've read Maison Ikoku, and Mermaid Forest
                                  (seen a couple of videos), and... ::draws a
                                  blank on the name of the current Rumiko

AV         10/7/01  3:05 AM  if you ever get the chance to watch Here Is
                                  Greenwood, take it... it's fun... not what
                                  you'd expect, and kind of subtle... but it has
                                  a very real feel to it... it would be a great
                                  setting for throwing characters from other
                                  anime into (like OMG)
                                  
                                  Thanks... I know it was the demon-dog's
                                  name... but I'm so bad with names!

AV         10/7/01  3:08 AM  You know... I think a fun character to play
                                  with is Megumi, Kenchii's little sister from
                                  Oh My Goddess... she's the right age to mix it
                                  up with the Ranma characters... are you
                                  familiar with OMG? There'd be plenty of
                                  characters to drag into the Ranmaverse from
                                  there... combined with the Tenchi Universe,
                                  that would make for a great play ground!

AV         10/7/01  3:08 AM  With Urd in the game, you might not even need
                                  the Master PC!

AV         10/7/01  3:09 AM  Ergh! Imagine if SHE got her hands on the MPC!

Kaori-Chan 10/7/01  3:09 AM  urrr... not too familiar woth AMS (OMG in
                                  america)

AV         10/7/01  3:09 AM  grrrr! it would be so perfect! ah well...

AV         10/7/01  3:11 AM  one of my favorite fan fics involved cross
                                  over from Ranma, Tenchi and OMG!... of course
                                  I'd also enjoy mixing OMG! and Orion... do you
                                  know Orion?

Kaori-Chan 10/7/01  3:13 AM  Other than it being my middle name? no.

AV         10/7/01  3:14 AM  the truth is, I doubt I know any of these
                                  series well enough to do a good job of playing
                                  with them... I don't have access to my
                                  comic-manga-anime collection... it's all up in
                                  Portland with my former roommates...

                                  realize that until you try to have some...
                                  ::giggles::

AV         10/7/01  3:15 AM  mmm... I know of many characters that would be
                                  fun to play, but I don't know the series or
                                  the characters at all first hand... 

AV         10/7/01  3:16 AM  ...

AV         10/7/01  3:16 AM  of course, I could always play an avon... as
                                  an original character! ::gales of laughter
                                  pour forth::

Kaori-Chan 10/7/01  3:17 AM  ^^;;;
                                  
                                  

AV         10/7/01  3:20 AM  I have a character that would be perfect...
                                  not an avatar, but someone I created as a npc
                                  for an IRL RP a few years ago... AND she
                                  traveled to japan and became a rock
                                  singer/adventurer... she has blue hair, a
                                  deep, vibrant, electric blue... like blue
                                  flame... she's a shape changer with a plasma
                                  based psychokinesis... sort of like force
                                  manipulation... and she called herself
                                  Alias... ::giggles, remembering::

Kaori-Chan 10/7/01  3:21 AM  hehehehe... well, think over it... and
                                  familiarize yourself with new anime's.  What's
                                  sad is you've seen more than I have.  ^^;

AV         10/7/01  3:22 AM  she was an american high school student, so
                                  she'd be about 16 or 17... hmmm... as for
                                  familiarizing myself with new anime... only if
                                  I can steal it online... I am financially
                                  strapped...

Kaori-Chan 10/7/01  3:22 AM  you need to find you a nice dorm full of
                                  geeks.

AV         10/7/01  3:25 AM  well... where I live is not far off the
                                  mark... it's just... it's hard to find good
                                  anime at video rentals... I know if there was,
                                  I could get Launce to pick something every
                                  week... and, though we have Disk Access, there
                                  aren't any channels that show good anime... 
                                  
                                  truth is, anime is a luxury I gave up in hope
                                  of... well, you know... 
                                  see if you can get your hands on some of the
                                  stuff I listed... you might be better able to
                                  take in new anime than me...

AV         10/7/01  3:27 AM  for what you want to do... I don't think we
                                  need to be all that precise... for me, I just
                                  need an understanding of the character, and I
                                  can go with the flow... we don't have to fit
                                  this into the plot of any series, so... let's
                                  not stress over it...

Kaori-Chan 10/7/01  3:28 AM  *Nod nods* My lower back aches.  ^^;

AV         10/7/01  3:28 AM  if you want me to play an interesting, but
                                  normal girl... Megumi Morisato is probably
                                  just the thing... she's been around some
                                  really weird shit... goddesses, demons,
                                  magic... and for the most part remained
                                  unaware of any of it

AV         10/7/01  3:29 AM  I sort of understand her character, she's sort
                                  of a tech nut... thanks to her brother... but
                                  she's got a good sense of humor, her own
                                  personality, and spirit...

AV         10/7/01  3:30 AM  and... it would not be hard to believe that
                                  she would know Nabiki Tendou... or vice
                                  versa... I could have a lot of fun developing
                                  her in Ranma or Tenchi settings...

Kaori-Chan 10/7/01  3:31 AM  ^.^;;;;;;  my lower back hurts.

AV         10/9/01  3:02 AM  I figured as much... that's okay... I had fun
                                  stretching it out for myself... ::hugs and

AV         10/9/01  3:02 AM  oh yeeeeeeesssss!!!

AV         10/9/01  3:04 AM  um... how about you?

Kaori-Chan 10/9/01  3:04 AM  of course I did... ::kisses you:: And some

                                  um... wonderful foreplay... what did you
                                  think?

Kaori-Chan 10/9/01  3:07 AM  ::Shrugs:: we've talked about it before. 
                                  ::Smiles::  I agree.

AV         10/9/01  3:08 AM  ::nods:: you know I don't mean to impose...
                                  these are things that I tripped over while
                                  trying to figure myself out... it's just
                                  that... since meeting you, they've begun to
                                  take on potentially greater meaning... if you
                                  know what I mean! ::laughs::

Kaori-Chan 10/9/01  3:09 AM  ::Shrugs, hands and arms open in offering:: We
                                  are two of the destined few, a greater fate
                                  awaits us in our lives.

AV         10/9/01  3:13 AM  I can cope with that... but, I don't think I
                                  ever asked you... was Rose as "intuitive"
                                  smart as I am?

Kaori-Chan 10/9/01  3:17 AM  Yes... she was my wife, after all.  She was a
                                  smart, independant woman who had a good head
                                  on her shoulders, and a good wit for strategy
                                  and puzzles.

AV         10/9/01  3:23 AM  ::nods:: okay... sorry for the delay... it
                                  told me you went off line, so I ran in and
                                  finished the dishes...

AV         10/9/01  3:24 AM  the other question I had was... how do you
                                  feel about having a third person in our
                                  relationship, an avon triplet who is...
                                  essentually a fusion of you and me?

Kaori-Chan 10/9/01  3:25 AM  Wouldn't it be like having a child?

AV         10/9/01  3:27 AM  not quite... she would be the same age as
                                  us... she would remember and know all the
                                  things we do... she would be us, the
                                  resurrection of the soul we divided...

AV         10/9/01  3:27 AM  and, she would be born a "goddess"

Kaori-Chan 10/9/01  3:28 AM  ::Shrugs:: I would not mind in the least.

AV         10/9/01  3:28 AM  hmmm... for all I know... she'd be a
                                  reincarnation of Rhiannon... ::shrugs::

Kaori-Chan 10/9/01  3:29 AM  Alex, I love you, and anything that is a part
                                  of you...  so I would in turn love this being.

AV         10/9/01  3:31 AM  ::slips her arms around your neck and presses
                                  her forehead to yours:: I am sure you would
                                  love her... in a sense, she is who you and I
                                  would be if we remained the same soul... 

Kaori-Chan 10/9/01  3:32 AM  ::Nods, smiling gently:: Alex, you're my one
                                  and only.

AV         10/9/01  3:35 AM  ::traces your smile with a finger:: I really
                                  do hope that's a good thing... I know, I'm
                                  being silly...
                                  so, even the part where I said you identify as
                                  male and dragon, at the core, doesn't raise
                                  your hackles? 

AV         10/9/01  3:38 AM  I ask that because, for me, I can cope with
                                  admitting that I have a male side... but if I
                                  try to define myself as a man I get this panic
                                  and almost start foaming at the mouth! I mean,
                                  I've got what it takes to be a man, and I am
                                  glad of it, because it makes me a better
                                  person... and I think that under the right
                                  circumstances I could even have some fun with
                                  it... but... it's not really me... know what I
                                  mean?

AV         10/9/01  3:41 AM  after what happened... these long pauses make
                                  me really uneasy... ::bites her lip::

AV         10/9/01  3:43 AM  still there?

Kaori-Chan 10/9/01  3:43 AM  Don't worry hon, just letting you talk a
                                  moment.

AV         10/9/01  3:43 AM  did you get my last couple of questions?

Kaori-Chan 10/9/01  3:44 AM  No, I'm not offended by the dragon comment,
                                  the male comment... ehh.. dragon is often
                                  associated with male because it is a power
                                  totem in many civilizations.
                                  
                                  Really I'm genderless and gender defined in
                                  the same instant.

AV         10/9/01  3:45 AM  in other words, I really bring out the guy in
                                  you? ::laughs::

Kaori-Chan 10/9/01  3:48 AM  No.  You bring out the Allen in me.

AV         10/9/01  3:50 AM  I agree with you about the association of male
                                  with dragon... I suppose the thing that stands
                                  out as important is that you define yourself
                                  as Dragon... and with Dragon, gender is very
                                  fluid... 
                                  
                                  as for bringing out Allen... I love it, I
                                  really do... but... I am also very interested
                                  in your female side... I want to be in touch
                                  with that (and to touch that) too... it is one
                                  of the things about you that I loved, even
                                  before I found you...

AV         10/9/01  3:51 AM  I don't know... the thought of you as my twin
                                  is tremendously attractive.. ::grins::

AV         10/9/01  3:52 AM  gender is not a powerful enough duality to
                                  split a soul, while dragon and phoenix is... I
                                  think that its normal for both of us to be
                                  ambi gendered... ::caresses your face::

AV         10/9/01  3:54 AM  mmm... it's getting really late...

Kaori-Chan 10/9/01  3:55 AM  Yes, I know...  I've got two pages for
                                  tomorrow I have to write.  ^^;

AV         10/9/01  3:56 AM  I got too distracted to work on my writing...
                                  I shut all that down to focus on you... I
                                  should probably be off to bed now... ::wraps
                                  herself around you and holds on::

                                  to... I'd so much rather curl up in your arms
                                  and drift off to sleep, never leaving your
                                  side... mmmm... ::kisses you on the side of

Kaori-Chan 10/9/01  4:02 AM  ::Grins:: I just want to talk with you a bit

                                  ::kisses you on the cheek and turns around in
                                  your arms to lean up against you::

AV         10/9/01  4:08 AM  mmm... I can't think of much to talk about...
                                  we've pretty much covered what was on my
                                  mind... how about you?

AV         10/9/01  4:10 AM  okay, here's a question... if in real life,
                                  after we've made love, and you have had
                                  enough... how would it affect you if I
                                  stretched out in bed beside you and
                                  masturbated for another hour or two?

AV         10/9/01  4:14 AM  ::pokes you:: am I still getting through?

Kaori-Chan 10/9/01  4:15 AM  yes... hmm... well, depends on the reason for
                                  it.  If you were not satisfied by me, I might
                                  feel self conscious.  If you were but were
                                  just insatiably horny BECAUSE of great sex...
                                  I wouldn't mind.

AV         10/9/01  4:18 AM  hmmm... I really don't look to someone else to
                                  satisfy me... for me the satisfaction is in
                                  the intimacy, in the moment, not the
                                  conclusion... I'm a very emotional and sensual
                                  and tactile person... and touch is a very
                                  "now" sort of experience... I do it because I
                                  am alive and happy to be me, and I fuck
                                  because I like to share myself with people I
                                  care about... I don't think that ought to make
                                  you feel any insecurity, right?

Kaori-Chan 10/9/01  4:23 AM  true, but... well... think of it from a
                                  different perspective.

AV         10/9/01  4:26 AM  I suppose it would be clearer to say, I don't
                                  place expectations on sex, because the
                                  attraction is being touched by the unknown, so
                                  it's a mystery, which makes every aspect of it
                                  wonderful... a man who cares enough to be a
                                  good or even great lover is simply
                                  priceless... but by being the man I love,
                                  he... that is *you* touch me in a special way
                                  in everything you do... it would be rude to
                                  allow room for disappointment... that's just
                                  selfish, and I don't want to be selfish about
                                  sex

Kaori-Chan 10/9/01  4:27 AM  ::Hugs you:: I'm not worried about that.  ^^;
                                  
                                  of course, if you did that you might make me
                                  horny for another go at it...

AV         10/9/01  4:29 AM  I think the best way to explain it is, I have
                                  a healthy love for myself, so... I take myself
                                  for a lover... there is a difference between
                                  you wanting to make me happy and me wanting to
                                  make myself happy... and if you got worked up
                                  and wanted to join in, well, wonderful... I'm
                                  certainly not a jealous lover!
                                  
                                  as long as you understand that it's part of
                                  being me, and not some comment on you...
                                  you're always welcome to touch me, tease me,
                                  love me... 

Kaori-Chan 10/9/01  4:30 AM  ::Nods, hugging you:: How  is the writing
                                  going?

AV         10/9/01  4:30 AM  I have an obligation to see to my own needs...
                                  anything you do to me or for me is a gift...
                                  um... not writing, just keeping you company
                                  for a bit, then I am off to bed...

Kaori-Chan 10/9/01  4:31 AM  How is the writing COMING though?

AV         10/9/01  4:34 AM  um... not good... I thought I had it all
                                  figured out, but after talking to you I sort
                                  of lost my perspective on it... I'm trying to
                                  figure out what the focus of the story is...
                                  once again I've discovered that the "story" is
                                  actually a revelation of some hidden truth...
                                  bleah!

Kaori-Chan 10/9/01  4:34 AM  you're not giving up on the story again, are
                                  you?

AV         10/9/01  4:37 AM  nope, just taking a step back to put it all
                                  back in perspective... you see, all the stuff
                                  I told you about tonight was the basis of the
                                  story I was working on... the problem is, I
                                  was looking at it from the perspercetive of
                                  resolving my own soul... um... maybe that's a
                                  bit confusing...

Kaori-Chan 10/9/01  4:38 AM  Can't really say much that I haven't said
                                  before.

AV         10/9/01  4:40 AM  its really that you got me thinking and I
                                  realized that I was way ahead of myself...
                                  I've started to get a grip on it again, and
                                  once I know where things end up, I'll have a
                                  better idea of what has to happen to get
                                  there... 

Kaori-Chan 10/9/01  4:42 AM  could you write a small, two or three page
                                  snippet from Kaehmi's point of view?

AV         10/9/01  4:45 AM  I honestly don't know... I don't think I could
                                  manage it any time soon... not that I don't
                                  want to contribute to FC, but... I've got so
                                  much on my mind already...
                                  
                                  I've tried to work on stories totally seperate
                                  from my own life, but... they don't survive my
                                  muse... everything gets sucked into the effort
                                  to realize my self... that always has top
                                  priority

Kaori-Chan 10/9/01  4:47 AM  I asked because everything turns into some
                                  self actualized story.
                                  
                                  If you can't write a short story that has
                                  nothing to do with yourself....  *Sighs*

AV         10/9/01  4:47 AM  to write something like that I'd have to
                                  collaborate with you on line, actually write
                                  it *with* you... cuz then you'd be n a
                                  position to keep me on track... if you want to
                                  try that, I'm game... 

AV         10/9/01  4:48 AM  at least, to develope the outline of events,
                                  and get some inspiration and details from
                                  you... working on my own I wouldn't be able to
                                  come up with anything

Kaori-Chan 10/9/01  4:49 AM  Try it... just by yourself.
                                  
                                  I tried to collaberate a while ago and you
                                  ended up convoluting a simple little girls
                                  representation.  ^^;

AV         10/9/01  4:50 AM  that's an example of what happens when I try
                                  to draw inspiration from within myself...

                                  know... but you don't go through what I have

                                  it'll take time... it'll take time

Kaori-Chan 10/9/01  4:52 AM  If you can't write something without involving
                                  yourself in it...
                                  
                                  *Shrugs*
                                  
                                  it is only a short snippet, if you can do even
                                  that.

AV         10/9/01  4:56 AM  I don't know... this might be something best
                                  kept until I can be there with you... still,
                                  I'll try to keep it in mind as something to
                                  work on if I'm stuck with what I am currently
                                  working on... or just to get a break from it
                                  
                                  I won't say no... just that I don't know how
                                  quickly I am likely to get to it... is that
                                  fair enough?

                                  between a girl's rape fantasy and a boy's rape
                                  fantasy... or maybe not, perhaps more like the
                                  difference between a rape fantasy and an
                                  actual rape... I don't think that really
                                  explains it, though...

Kaori-Chan 10/12/01 10:16 PM so... you found it disconcerting.

AV         10/12/01 10:22 PM in part... I made an assumption about what the
                                  *rules* were... thought I was prepared for
                                  what might happen and was okay with that...
                                  when something came up that didn't fit into my
                                  assumption I... how to I put it, it's that
                                  moment when your mind goes, "This is *not*
                                  what I signed on for..." that moment when you
                                  realize you don't know the rules of the game
                                  
                                  when that happens in reality, that is a
                                  "BadThing" but when it happens in fantasy or
                                  role play... it just turns you off... 
                                  
                                  it's my mistake for making assumptions, and
                                  I'm sorry... I should have been able to play
                                  along with you, no matter where you went

AV         10/12/01 10:23 PM if I hadn't been distracted, I might have been
                                  able to adjust better

Kaori-Chan 10/12/01 10:25 PM ::Shrugs:: it's okay hon, I forgive you.  I
                                  love you.  Though I worry about roleplaying
                                  with you when it seems we always run into
                                  something you don't feel comfortable with.

AV         10/12/01 10:29 PM ::smiles:: I agree... I'm afraid it sort of
                                  comes with the territority when you are more
                                  real in your dreams and imagination than in
                                  the physical world... these things have a
                                  stronger impact on you... they're a lot closer
                                  to being real because they happen on the level
                                  where you primarily exist... the only world
                                  where I am truly myself is in the world in my
                                  mind, so I have to be somewhat careful what I
                                  let into that world, or at least be prepared
                                  for it

AV         10/12/01 10:35 PM ::sighs:: ah, once again I disappoint you...

Kaori-Chan 10/12/01 10:36 PM not disappointed.  I just don't understand, I
                                  guess.
                                  
                                  You can be anyone in your mind, and even if
                                  something happens to the image in your mind,
                                  you can always remake it and it will be the
                                  same as before, untouched, unblemished... but
                                  why do that when you can make other people in
                                  your mind and have them act out parts in
                                  roleplaying games?

AV         10/12/01 10:44 PM I am not surprised you don't understand it...
                                  this is one of the major differences between
                                  the dragon psyche and the phoenix psyche...
                                  it's almost funny to see it proved true like
                                  this...
                                  
                                  what you just described is one of the defining
                                  traits of a dragon, the ability to dream up
                                  all manner of people, places and things with
                                  supreme detachment... while a phoenix has
                                  similar creative ability, she is always forced
                                  to create them from herself... to make them
                                  real, she has to invest herself in them,
                                  become them... and as a result these things
                                  can become part of her self image
                                  
                                  its one of the things that sort of explain why
                                  phoenixes are less well known for their
                                  metamorphic abilities

Kaori-Chan 10/12/01 10:46 PM so what, no hope for roleplaying?

AV         10/12/01 10:50 PM or maybe it's appropriate to say that dragons
                                  and phoenixes both create from themselves...
                                  but the essence of a phoenix always strives to
                                  return to itself, seeking resurrection in the
                                  One, which tends to bring the creations back
                                  into her
                                  
                                  I would not say no hope... for a dragon, it
                                  comes naturally... but part of the whole Two
                                  as One thing is that my connection to you has
                                  allowed me to recognize and try to develop my
                                  own dragon potential... it doesn't come easy,
                                  but it is possible for me to do what you do so
                                  well
                                  
                                  I am working on it... 

Kaori-Chan 10/12/01 10:52 PM *Nod nods*

Kaori-Chan 10/12/01 10:52 PM could we RP?? Roland skipped out on me as he
                                  so punctually does every time.

AV         10/12/01 10:53 PM we each have our vulnerabilities... and I
                                  think we both tend to respect them... 
                                  
                                  well... were you planning to be up all night
                                  at this? (I don't object, but I need to know
                                  so I can wrap up all my distractions soonest)

Kaori-Chan 10/12/01 10:54 PM Uhm... I plan to be up for a good while
                                  longer, yah.

AV         10/12/01 10:54 PM okay... what sort of game did you have in
                                  mind?

Kaori-Chan 10/12/01 10:55 PM wanted to try with you what I was trying with
                                  Roland, a Nabiki RP.  ^.^

AV         10/12/01 10:56 PM err... that doesn't quite answer my
                                  question...

Kaori-Chan 10/12/01 10:56 PM Well... typically, I call it the Omnipotent
                                  Kaori.  Kind of evil Kaori who likes messing
                                  with people.  ^^;

AV         10/12/01 10:58 PM So, another round of Master PC? You had Roland
                                  playing Nabs and now you want me to play her?

Kaori-Chan 10/12/01 10:58 PM Not Master PC... something a bit different.
                                  
                                  but yes to the second part.

AV         10/12/01 10:59 PM Hmmm... does it have to be Nabiki? 

Kaori-Chan 10/12/01 10:59 PM would prefer it, but why do you ask?

AV         10/12/01 11:03 PM part of it is, you seem to target her a lot...
                                  and I don't think I'm very good at playing
                                  her... I admit, of the Ranma cast, she's one
                                  of the more interesting characters... all of
                                  the characters have some serious limitations,
                                  but her's do work well in the situations you
                                  like to explore... ::taps her lip with her
                                  index finger, thoughtfully::

Kaori-Chan 10/12/01 11:06 PM ::Waits::

AV         10/12/01 11:13 PM ::sighs:: I hate to say it, though it shows my
                                  sympathy for your perspective, but she's a
                                  much more interesting person to play with than
                                  to play, if you get my meaning... 
                                  
                                  okay... let's just set that aside a minute and
                                  let me ask, is there anything else that
                                  interests you?

Kaori-Chan 10/12/01 11:13 PM what do you mean?

AV         10/12/01 11:17 PM well... then you say RP you mean Hentai... so
                                  the scope of things are generally limited to,
                                  as you say, "getting your rocks off" so I know
                                  we're not getting into in depth plot and
                                  character development... that means a game is
                                  defined by a situation and a "subject" for
                                  your attentions
                                  
                                  do I have that much right, at least?

Kaori-Chan 10/12/01 11:18 PM generally, yes.  In rare times, I am the
                                  subject and the other person master of the
                                  situation.

AV         10/12/01 11:21 PM and you tend to focus on the Ranma characters
                                  because we already know them, their
                                  situations, Nerima, etc, so no time has to be
                                  wasted figuring the characters out, right?

Kaori-Chan 10/12/01 11:21 PM generally, yes... I actually used to do a lot
                                  more un-associated RPing, but... it took a
                                  while to make a character up, and most people
                                  have no variant imagination.

AV         10/12/01 11:25 PM okay... this might sound weak.. but... it sort
                                  of rubs me the wrong way to play one of the
                                  case when you are playing a self-insert
                                  character... partly because I don't know Kaoru
                                  the way I know the cast, and I have a hard
                                  time fitting him in to the picture... or else
                                  I get this strong urge to want to play Daijiro
                                  instead
                                  
                                  and I know you don't want me to play Ranma,
                                  who is the one character in the cast I would
                                  want to play

AV         10/12/01 11:25 PM case = cast (first line)

Kaori-Chan 10/12/01 11:26 PM Don't think of it as self insert, think of it
                                  as villain of the week.  That happened in
                                  Ranma constantly...
                                  
                                  

Kaori-Chan 10/12/01 11:26 PM If you want, I could play a character with an
                                  entirely different name who looks nothing like
                                  Kaoru... the reason I use Kaoru is because
                                  then I don't have to use aliases or change my
                                  nickname.

AV         10/12/01 11:31 PM I can think of it anyway I want, but that
                                  won't change the way I feel about it... it's
                                  more the fact that he isn't one of the cast...
                                  Kuno, or Taro or even Gosenkugi, I wouldn't
                                  put it past them to cross the line and go
                                  hentai on a member of the cast, and I'd have a
                                  better feel for the situation with one of them
                                  
                                  playing Dai, I think, is an impulse to put
                                  myself in equal footing... using the familiar
                                  setting and background, but play it from the
                                  hip
                                  ::shakes her head:: I don't mean to argue,
                                  it's just... we only talk about these things
                                  when you ask to play, and all my thoughts come
                                  boiling to the surface

Kaori-Chan 10/12/01 11:31 PM guess we're not playing then.

AV         10/12/01 11:32 PM for crying out loud, it's not rocket
                                  science... it's just HRP! I don't know why I
                                  have problems getting into it...

Kaori-Chan 10/13/01 8:43 PM  yoooohoooo...

AV         10/13/01 9:46 PM  sorry I missed you... I was away eating
                                  dinner... ::hugs::

Kaori-Chan 10/13/01 11:29 PM I'm here.

AV         10/13/01 11:30 PM hi hi... ever see "Paradise Lost"?

Kaori-Chan 10/13/01 11:31 PM SEE it? No, but it is a book written by a guy
                                  named Milton.

AV         10/13/01 11:34 PM ah, something completely different... it wa
                                  also the title of an HO special about a modern
                                  day witch trial...

Kaori-Chan 10/13/01 11:34 PM aaaah...  Milton's PARADISE LOST was about...
                                  well.. The fall of Lucifer.

AV         10/13/01 11:37 PM ::nods:: what I am talking about is the
                                  Woodsborough Hills Murders, three teenage boys
                                  were arrested and convicted of the murder, and
                                  in one case sexual mutilation, of three 8 year
                                  old boys without a shred of evidence... they
                                  were convicted pretty much on the basis of
                                  listening to rock music, quoting peices of
                                  morbid literature (Shakespeare, for crying out
                                  loud!) and wearing black clothes...

AV         10/13/01 11:40 PM I'm reading the details of the case, so... a
                                  bit distracted...

AV         10/13/01 11:41 PM http://www.wm3.org/html/profile.html

AV         10/13/01 11:44 PM um... my mistake... it was the Robin Hood
                                  Hills, not Woodsburough...

Kaori-Chan 10/13/01 11:45 PM aaaaaah.

AV         10/13/01 11:50 PM so, what's up with you?

Kaori-Chan 10/13/01 11:50 PM not much, Roland asking to roleplay old
                                  scenes.

AV         10/13/01 11:52 PM okay... think you will?

AV         10/13/01 11:56 PM I don't know if I'll be up to playing for a
                                  bit... I'll let you know when I am free...

Kaori-Chan 10/13/01 11:57 PM not much, Roland asking to roleplay old
                                  scenes.

Kaori-Chan 10/13/01 11:57 PM I was enjoying that Nabiki one I was doing.  I
                                  get on kicks and go with them for a while...  

AV         10/13/01 11:58 PM mmm... I am assuming you mean a Nabiki one you
                                  were playing with Roland... and he doesn't
                                  want to continue with it...

Kaori-Chan 10/14/01 12:04 AM yeah, he says he wasn't really into it...
                                  which was probably the reason he wanted to go
                                  to bed (And had nothing to do with being
                                  tired).

AV         10/14/01 12:10 AM awww... well, at least I was around last
                                  night... ::smiles::

Kaori-Chan 10/14/01 12:20 AM Roland misunderstood what I was doing with
                                  it... ^>^ he thought I was doing something not
                                  in his taste, he was mistaken.

Kaori-Chan 10/14/01 12:46 AM come into Ranmania.

Kaori-Chan 10/14/01 2:00 AM  I'm gonna go hon... ^>^

AV         10/14/01 2:01 AM  kk

Kaori-Chan 10/16/01 9:16 PM  grock.

AV         10/16/01 9:17 PM  *pounce* ::hugs you::

Kaori-Chan 10/16/01 9:17 PM  ::Huggles back 'n cops a feel of your rear::

AV         10/16/01 9:19 PM  ::jumps and sticks her tongue in your ear::
                                  oops!
                                  
                                  what's up?

Kaori-Chan 10/16/01 9:20 PM  not much, sweety... what about with you? ^>^

AV         10/16/01 9:21 PM  ooo... I'm running on fumes... I was up til 7
                                  am... got up at 10 am... been busy all day... 
                                  still, it's nothing compared to the night
                                  before... had a blinding migrane

Kaori-Chan 10/16/01 9:22 PM  aww... ::Snuggles:: No playing then, huh?
                                  ::kisses::

AV         10/16/01 9:24 PM  mmm... probably not a good idea... I am gonna
                                  start crashing soon... on the other hand, I
                                  needed to fix my sleep schedule, people were
                                  strating to bitch about me waking up in the
                                  afternoon... you can work all night, 14 hours
                                  straight, but if they don't see you busy, they
                                  think you're slacking off... ::sigh::

Kaori-Chan 10/16/01 9:25 PM  so which hand is it? The one or the other? ^>^

AV         10/16/01 9:28 PM  it's a bad thing cuz once I get my schedule
                                  set, I can only be up til 2 am (here) which
                                  will mean no more long nights... it's a good
                                  thing, cuz I'll be up by 10 am every day,
                                  which means I'll be getting more work done,
                                  and I'll be around before you go to classes,
                                  so we'll still be able to talk (maybe as much
                                  as 6 hours in the mornings?)

Kaori-Chan 10/16/01 9:28 PM  Not typically up that early.  ^>^;;

AV         10/16/01 9:30 PM  what? 9 am is too earwy for oo?

AV         10/16/01 9:31 PM  ah, well... I am sure you have tons of other
                                  people to keep you up all night besides me...
                                  sorry

Kaori-Chan 10/16/01 9:32 PM  heehee... usually.  ^>^
                                  
                                  Of course, this week has me getting up that
                                  early to go help with mail... which I trust
                                  will not become a habit because I always fail
                                  all my classes when my parents start using me
                                  like that.

Kaori-Chan 10/16/01 9:32 PM  I don't plan on staying up all night tonight. 
                                  O>o

AV         10/16/01 9:34 PM  mmm... since this is a tuesday night, I didn't
                                  expect you to be on at all... that's why I
                                  skipped on sleep to reset my schedule
                                  tonight... I figured it wouldn't end up
                                  effecting you
                                  
                                  so, what happened with you regular tues night
                                  gig?

Kaori-Chan 10/16/01 9:34 PM  this whole week I am helping with mail.

AV         10/16/01 9:35 PM  ah ::she murmurs sagely::

Kaori-Chan 10/16/01 9:36 PM  So I am a little perplexed as to the meaning
                                  of the recent section of our discussion.

AV         10/16/01 9:37 PM  mmm? I'm a bit phased... what have we been
                                  talking about recently?
                                  (last thing I can recall was about RP...)

Kaori-Chan 10/16/01 9:37 PM  that's what I meant.  I am confused as to the
                                  status of that topic.

AV         10/16/01 9:39 PM  what... roleplaying? ::scratches her head::
                                  dunno... can't think of anything at the
                                  moment...

Kaori-Chan 10/16/01 9:39 PM  you said on one hand you were tired and would
                                  probably crash soon, but on the other hand you
                                  were reorganizing your sleeping schedule...
                                  O.o

AV         10/16/01 9:40 PM  ah, yes... I don't wake up easily on my own,
                                  so I have to stay up ungodly hours to change
                                  my sleeping pattern, ge really tired and go to
                                  bed early and get enough rest to wake up
                                  earlier...

Kaori-Chan 10/16/01 9:41 PM  okay.  I'm still confused.  ^^;
                                  But not about that.

AV         10/16/01 9:42 PM  were you asking if I'd be up to RP tonight?

Kaori-Chan 10/16/01 9:43 PM  uh.. yes, I am confused as to the status of
                                  the answer.  O.o

AV         10/16/01 9:44 PM  oh... ::sighs and takes your hand:: not
                                  tonight, hon... I'm just barely awake right
                                  now... I'm not even writing, just sifting
                                  through files for some missing notes

Kaori-Chan 10/16/01 9:45 PM  oh... okay.

AV         10/16/01 9:46 PM  ::snuggles close:: I'm really sorry, I
                                  honestly thought this was a safe night for me
                                  to play zombie all day...

Kaori-Chan 10/16/01 9:46 PM  I'm not upset, I just said okay.  ^>^

AV         10/16/01 9:47 PM  you don't have to be upset for me to feel
                                  sympathy for your wants and needs... you
                                  wanted to have some fun, I know...

Kaori-Chan 10/16/01 9:47 PM  yah, but I'm not too worried about it hon. 
                                  ^>^ I can always do other things.  ::Kiss::

AV         10/16/01 9:48 PM  mmmm.... ::lingers at your lips joyfully and

                                  I wait
                                  In the aching of my rage
                                  	The second turns
                                  Within the sensual flesh
                                  In the ghost of its depths
                                  Embraced within
                                  The idea

                                  I wait
                                  In this carnal frame-my cage
                                  	The spirit yearns
                                  Again, if the flesh is willing
                                  Shall the sense transcend the flesh
                                  A silent promise
                                  A fear

                                  Consuming the will of flesh
                                  To defy the shattered mind
                                  Tempting oblivion

                                  To know

AV         10/16/01 9:52 PM  These were all going to be section breaks in a
                                  manuscript, so they are some of my best...
                                  another...
                                  
                                  It's a little bit like falling

                                  I feel it always calling

                                  I wonder that it kills me

                                  What awareness could ever ride
                                  Safely in this maelstrom
                                  And hope to reach the other side
                                  As whole as what once made from

Kaori-Chan 10/16/01 9:53 PM  That one is nice too, hon.

AV         10/16/01 9:54 PM  ::smiles and bows::
                                  
                                  What worry is this?
                                  What great traumatic dread?
                                  I look to see what I miss
                                  So far behind or way ahead
                                  
                                  And presently I come to find
                                  How near at hand it is
                                  The line's been drawn inside my mind
                                  Of what so unbending 'tis
                                  
                                  Andrea Morgan 1993

Kaori-Chan 10/16/01 9:55 PM  that last line is a bit of an awkward
                                  formation.

AV         10/16/01 9:57 PM  I never wrote the third verse... I couldn't
                                  put the object of the poem into words... so it
                                  remains a shadowed poem...There are a couple
                                  more... this is one I really like... it needs
                                  to be read to the sound of a heartbeat...
                                  
                                  Light falls
                                  And strikes my soul
                                  Death calls
                                  And leaves me cold
                                  I see
                                  The great Abyss
                                  Could be
                                  A thing like this
                                  Can I
                                  Take back control?
                                  Am I
                                  Not still whole?
                                  What mystery
                                  Is this thing
                                  That history
                                  Did never sing?
                                  The answer
                                  Is in my grasp
                                  One chance or
                                  One final gasp?
                                  I can
                                  Not lose tonight
                                  In this stand
                                  For my first sight!

Kaori-Chan 10/16/01 9:59 PM  ^.^  you were 23 that year.

AV         10/16/01 10:00 PM ::nods:: these were actually written
                                  throughout the year of 1990, but I dated them
                                  the year I was working on the manuscript.
                                  Here, a somewhat darker, more desperate
                                  poem... and, yes... it's entirely free
                                  verse...
                                  
                                  I come unto the line
                                  The part that is all things
                                  Wedged between the unimaginable
                                  
                                  I search for some sign
                                  
                                  Swallowed by the indiscribible
                                  Flowing into immensity
                                  I grasp the true meaning
                                  
                                  But the words are just holes
                                  
                                  Splinters of insanity
                                  And I find myself screaming
                                  As shards of reason close
                                  
                                  And I bleed with my soul
                                  
                                  Meaning comes from confinement
                                  Reality comes from restriction
                                  Life comes from death
                                  
                                  Arranged in a continuity
                                  
                                  Awareness escapes through abandonment
                                  Completeness arrives through perception
                                  Self, lost to transcend death
                                  
                                  And there is no sanity

Kaori-Chan 10/16/01 10:02 PM ::Snuggles:: Very nice poetry, though, I would
                                  look over your spelling sweety.

                                  I am going to go and play a video game, if
                                  that's okay.

AV         10/16/01 10:02 PM only two more to go... mind if I send them
                                  first?
                                  
                                  How strange, when I woke--my eyes...
                                  The world poised at my finger tips
                                  So wonderous and so profound to realize
                                  How things led to this
                                  
                                  No matter that I'd found the meaning
                                  All was made meaningless
                                  So blind, we always stumble, seeking
                                  So painful, bare, a truth like this
                                  
                                  No emotion and no salvation
                                  This great mystique-electric cold
                                  As pure as thought, this whole solution
                                  Has no heart, eternal, old
                                  
                                  As a truth, without dispute
                                  What has 'ere been
                                  Mere mortals could not dare refute
                                  such absolute precision

                                  Was wondering if you wanted to help me on some

                                  what sort of help did you need?

                                  give you the rough outline which I have and
                                  you can think on it if you want.

                                  go over it tonight... if you're on later
                                  tonight, I can give you my first impressions,

                                  History says there were two mages that worked
                                  on a project involving an artifact named the
                                  Star of Endymion.  Reports during the project
                                  stated that the fragments of the star had
                                  strange effects on space and time...  one day,
                                  the mages and their tower vanished along with
                                  the star.
                                  
                                  At the same time, in another dimension, a man
                                  who was in love/friends with/protective of
                                  this woman came into contact with the star
                                  (Actually, just the woman)
                                  
                                  The woman was split into three different
                                  aspects of herself.  Chora, Lyka, and Tropa.
                                  
                                  Somehow, the three aspects effectively
                                  destroyed the man's reality.

AV         10/23/01 9:17 PM  the guy who has feelings for the girl... I am
                                  not entirely clear on a few things about
                                  her... or them? were they the two mages...
                                  or... are they analogues of the two mages, or
                                  is she the only analogue?

Kaori-Chan 10/23/01 9:19 PM  *Sighs*
                                  
                                  Two Mages experimented.  The mages disappeared
                                  with their experiment.  Experiment shows up in
                                  unassosiated reality, interacts with female,
                                  female splits into three aspects... Female
                                  aspects proceed to destroy reality in which
                                  the (Singular) female lived along with the
                                  villain.

AV         10/23/01 9:25 PM  okay... two mages, star of endymion, woman,
                                  man... mages vanish with their tower, star
                                  splits woman, woman's three aspects destroy
                                  man's reality... and... okay, the part I am
                                  not getting here is, in what way is this guy
                                  the villian? 

Kaori-Chan 10/23/01 9:27 PM  one, his reality was destroyed.  two, the
                                  woman or friend he cared for is currently
                                  splitsville.  Three... he knows that this
                                  artifact she and he had seen did the
                                  splitting.

Kaori-Chan 10/23/01 9:28 PM  villains do not technically have to vye for
                                  power or abuse power already gained... 
                                  villains do not have to be a complete anithema
                                  to the position the heroes take.  The best
                                  villains are the villains you can
                                  understand... the best villains are the people
                                  you're afraid of becoming.

AV         10/23/01 9:33 PM  um... most people mean "bad guy" when they
                                  define someone as the villian... implying that
                                  he is an individual responsible for adverse
                                  circumstances or consequences... at the very
                                  least it is implied that the villian does
                                  something... from what you've described, it
                                  sounds more like the establishment for the
                                  protagonist...
                                  
                                  in what way is he responsible for the bad
                                  things that happen... I'll go for complicity
                                  or guilt in allowing something to happen that
                                  he could have stopped, and he chose not to...
                                  but, it seems to me that, based only on the
                                  little you've told me, that he's just a victim
                                  of circumstance... 

Kaori-Chan 10/23/01 9:34 PM  you are misunderstanding... the players aren't
                                  playing with this character, this is his
                                  motivation.  Why he wants to destroy one
                                  reality; to bring his own back into being.
                                  
                                  Chronomancer.

AV         10/23/01 9:37 PM  ah... sorry, I didn't have the full context to
                                  work with... 

Kaori-Chan 10/23/01 9:38 PM  He is looking for the three aspects of the
                                  woman because he wants to kill them... 
                                  originally he might have wanted to fix what
                                  went wrong, but he has abandoned that after
                                  his world was destroyed.

AV         10/23/01 9:41 PM  Can I ask... how does he become a power? who
                                  and what was he in his own world, or what did
                                  he become during this catastrophy, that makes
                                  him a danger, a power to be reckoned with?

Kaori-Chan 10/23/01 9:44 PM  His only escape from the distruction was to
                                  understand the basic function of the artifact
                                  that caused the woman to split... the Star of
                                  Endymion.
                                  
                                  The star is comprised of multiple parts, all
                                  identical, scattered across dimension, time,
                                  and space across the world.
                                  
                                  It is a latticework of pathways, essentially,
                                  but the material which comprises each objects
                                  center has bizarre effects on time and space
                                  in and of themselves.
                                  
                                  

AV         10/23/01 9:46 PM  so, both his power, and her power are derived
                                  from the Star of Endymion... she, because of
                                  what it did to her (and she obviously became
                                  quite powerful because of it)... do I assume
                                  that he has possession and control of the
                                  artifact (or some key to the associated
                                  matrix)?

AV         10/23/01 9:58 PM  still there?

Kaori-Chan 10/23/01 10:01 PM yes.  He learned to use it.
                                  
                                  The three aspects of her are oblivious to what
                                  they did...  they the players will meet, and
                                  will find out someone is trying to kill them
                                  or kidnap them.

AV         10/23/01 10:03 PM ::nods:: do they know each other, or what they
                                  are to each other?

Kaori-Chan 10/23/01 10:04 PM Not really, no, but if they meet eachother
                                  they do get an impression of oddness, or a
                                  sense of unease...
                                  
                                  all three together could, in some
                                  circumstances, be considered a very bad idea.

AV         10/23/01 10:05 PM unless you happen to be the original woman...
                                  in which case it might be the only way to
                                  become whole again... 

Kaori-Chan 10/23/01 10:08 PM It's a little like magnets, each is a
                                  different aspect of her personality
                                  magnified...  and each is different
                                  polarities, then the non-charged... which is
                                  the third.
                                  
                                  It is also representative of the past,
                                  present, and future.

AV         10/23/01 10:10 PM hmmm... I didn't inspire or influence this in
                                  any way, did I? (there are times when I feel
                                  as  if you've read more of my stuff than I've
                                  sent you copies of...) ::shakes her head,
                                  smiling::

Kaori-Chan 10/23/01 10:11 PM yes, you were inspiration for the idea.  ^^;

AV         10/23/01 10:13 PM Aahh... ^^;;

AV         10/23/01 10:18 PM mmm... okay then... I am assuming that the
                                  advanture takes place in the realm where the
                                  experiment took place... and that by
                                  destroying that reality, the villian believes
                                  he can restore (or perhaps prevent the
                                  original destruction of) his home realm... or
                                  something along those lines... um... how do
                                  the triplets manage to get from the destroyed
                                  realm to the realm he wants to destroy?

Kaori-Chan 10/23/01 10:19 PM that is a puzzle to be found out later.

AV         10/23/01 10:20 PM meaning you haven't decided yet...?

Kaori-Chan 10/23/01 10:20 PM there's a lot not decided about the game.

AV         10/23/01 10:20 PM guess so... that happens alot...

AV         10/23/01 10:26 PM hmmm... I'm not sure if I've said anything
                                  useful as yet... 

AV         10/23/01 10:40 PM ::tap, tap::

Kaori-Chan 10/23/01 10:42 PM ^.^

AV         10/23/01 10:44 PM whatcha doin?

Kaori-Chan 10/23/01 10:44 PM nothin' really.

AV         10/23/01 10:45 PM I'm bored... you?

Kaori-Chan 10/23/01 10:46 PM ehhh, waiting for D&D game.

AV         10/23/01 10:47 PM who, you?  oh, yeah... it's Tuesday night...

Kaori-Chan 10/23/01 10:49 PM ????

AV         10/23/01 10:54 PM you remember once telling me not to expect you
                                  to be here on tuesday nights?

Kaori-Chan 10/23/01 10:56 PM that was because of classes, not because of
                                  D&D....  my D&D is on thursdays.

AV         10/23/01 10:56 PM mmm... oh... still, that's what you're waiting
                                  up for tonight...

AV         10/23/01 10:59 PM I'm gonna go... feeling kinds burnt

Kaori-Chan 10/27/01 5:11 PM  ^.^  *Hugs*  Whatcha been thinkin'?

AV         10/27/01 5:12 PM  would you believe I still find it a new and
                                  wonderful experience to be in love with you?

Kaori-Chan 10/27/01 5:14 PM  *Smiles* No... I would not.

AV         10/27/01 5:18 PM  with anyone else, I would expect a person to
                                  back off and leave me alone with my problems
                                  and troubles, but I never get that impression
                                  from you... at the same time, I don't feel
                                  like you're just humoring me... when I strike
                                  you as dangerously self absorbed, you stand up
                                  to me and say I've got to try something
                                  different...
                                  
                                  I don't worry when I don't hear from you every
                                  day... we don't cling to each other, because
                                  we both know we're here for each other... I
                                  rather enjoy that

AV         10/27/01 5:19 PM  we may be far apart, but I don't feel alone
                                  with you in my life...

Kaori-Chan 10/27/01 5:21 PM  I have momentary bouts of loneliness, I am
                                  sure you have had moments of intimacy in your
                                  life, but I have been dreadfully isolated from
                                  such things... and when I try to express
                                  intimacy, it comes across in an intimidating
                                  fashion which startle most females (But most
                                  men seem to find attractive/appealing).

                                  I have my moments of loneliness, and for some

                                  have been the loneliest moments in my life...
                                  they were always driven by a kind of

                                  another thing that is so important about you
                                  is I can tell you anything.  Everything... and
                                  never, ever have to worry.

AV         10/27/01 5:45 PM  mmm... truth is, sexual adventurousness is so
                                  much easier as a girl... all you have to do is
                                  say yes... for a guy, you've gotta be some
                                  sort of Cassanova or Adonis, rich and or
                                  fameous... or infameous... and either a
                                  bastard or an asshole... I really don't
                                  understand what makes some guys prize studs

Kaori-Chan 10/27/01 5:55 PM  an hour back, right?

AV         10/27/01 5:56 PM  yep... at 2 am the clock jumps back to 1 am,
                                  at least if you're out bar hopping

Kaori-Chan 10/27/01 5:56 PM  aaah... heehee.

AV         10/27/01 5:58 PM  so, I'm up for a bit of role playing later
                                  tonight... don't worry about interfering with
                                  my writing, I've been drafted into helping
                                  create a haunted house thingie for Halloween
                                  and that's pretty much screwed up all my
                                  writing this week... and on through the
                                  31st...
                                  
                                  I'll just be shuffling notes on the side
                                  trying to keep it alive for the duration

Kaori-Chan 10/27/01 6:00 PM  *Nod nods* ARE you writing though?

AV         10/27/01 6:01 PM  umm... not exactly... not at the moment

Kaori-Chan 10/27/01 6:03 PM  have you done any writing is what I mean.

AV         10/27/01 6:05 PM  ::sighs:: I have to say no... I was putting it
                                  all together in my head, but there've been so
                                  many distractions lately that I can't keep any
                                  of it straight

                                  I have a good general idea of what I am trying
                                  to do, what the story is about, but... it's
                                  really kicking my ass

Kaori-Chan 10/27/01 6:14 PM  the hardest part with writing is beginning.

AV         10/27/01 6:19 PM  with my luck, I'll have it all figured out at
                                  2 am again, and when I get up and try to write
                                  it down I'll be interrupted again and it'll
                                  all be gone when I can finally sit back down
                                  again... I can't rely on my notes, because
                                  they describe the scenes and scenarios but not
                                  how they all fit together to make sense...
                                  that was the part I had worked out in my
                                  head... and I keep losing my grip on it

Kaori-Chan 10/27/01 6:19 PM  ^^;;

AV         10/27/01 6:21 PM  ::smiles and looks at you:: sucks, don' it?

Kaori-Chan 10/27/01 6:23 PM  ya. You should make a timeline.

AV         10/27/01 6:28 PM  um... to be honest, that was something I was
                                  working on when you showed up... I was
                                  scanning the notes to be sure I had all the
                                  key events in mind, and I was going to use
                                  that outline program you gave me to work out a
                                  time line... 
                                  
                                  because there is a temporal paradox, the
                                  timeline is based on the personal timeline of
                                  the main character... the biggest problem I
                                  was having was that there were a few different
                                  ways I could resolve the paradox, but they
                                  each radically changed the course of all the
                                  other events in the story
                                  
                                  I kind of want to end up with the story I had
                                  in mind... if I'm not careful, the story will
                                  take off in some weird direction of it's own
                                  unraveling the entire tapestry of plot threads

AV         10/27/01 6:31 PM  I'm being called away... I'll pop back in and
                                  let you know if this is going to take a while

AV         10/27/01 6:34 PM  mmm... Launce is having an Evil Dead marathon
                                  upstairs... I told him I'd have to skip it...
                                  um... you are still there, right?
                                  anyway, dinner will be in a half hour or so...
                                  that means I'll be free to RP starting at 9 my
                                  time... that sound good?

AV         10/27/01 6:37 PM  Mark?

Kaori-Chan 10/27/01 6:39 PM  I'm here... though I'll have to say pass on
                                  the roleplaying.  I have to interview someone
                                  tonight for a class, I had forgotten before I
                                  asked.  

AV         10/27/01 6:40 PM  oh... so you're gonna be busy tonight? do you
                                  think you'll have any time to chat tonight?

Kaori-Chan 10/27/01 6:40 PM  probably not tonight.  Eh... i seem to be
                                  pretty busy this semester with classes.

                                  me, y'know?

Kaori-Chan 10/27/01 6:42 PM  So long as it's not  you? O.o

AV         10/27/01 6:46 PM  I know that I've been a frustrating RP partner
                                  at times... I hope you never end up avoiding
                                  me cuz I'm too much of a hassle to deal
                                  with... I don't believe that's ever happened,
                                  but it's not hard to picture it happening

AV         11/3/01  12:36 AM well, just with the notes on hand, I could
                                  probably publish a HUGE campaign setting, as
                                  well as two or three RPG systems...

AV         11/3/01  12:39 AM as for the book itself, the plot is starting
                                  to make sense... I've been making progress...
                                  I don't think I have to write any notes for

                                  D&D game off the ground.
                                  
                                  ::hugs::
                                  
                                  You want to RP?

AV         11/3/01  12:45 AM ::smiles:: I hope that's going well...
                                  ::hugs you back:: As for RP, it depends...
                                  it's already pretty late, so we won't have a
                                  lot of time... if you've already got something
                                  in mind, though, we can give it a try

Kaori-Chan 11/3/01  12:45 AM aah.  When do you plan on going to bed?

AV         11/3/01  12:48 AM in about two hours at the latest... I was
                                  getting close to wrapping up my work for the
                                  evening, but I don't fall asleep very
                                  quickly... ::offers a wry smile:: I have this
                                  tendancy to start thinking about you... and
                                  that sort of gets me worked up ::winks::

Kaori-Chan 11/3/01  12:48 AM ::Giggles:: Well... we could do one of two
                                  things.  You wanted to continue that Nabiki
                                  one... but we also have that RP with Daijirou
                                  and Ranma.

AV         11/3/01  12:50 AM mmmm... we did Nabiki last time, so lets give
                                  Ranma and Dai a whirl, hey?

Kaori-Chan 11/3/01  12:50 AM Roland is on starchat, so am I.  ^.^

AV         11/3/01  12:51 AM okie, I'll fire up irc and join you there...
                                  un moment, ma cheri ::kiss::

AV         11/3/01  8:59 PM  It doesn't look like tonight is going to be a

AV         11/5/01  9:09 PM  Hello, Love! 
                                  
                                  How are you doing tonight? ::a welcoming

Kaori-Chan 11/5/01  9:10 PM  s'okay, I s'pose.  ^.^
                                  
                                  

AV         11/5/01  9:11 PM  Darling! You're talking to ME... that should
                                  make everything FABulous! ::giggles like a

                                  you!

Kaori-Chan 11/5/01  9:12 PM  yes? ::Smiles::

AV         11/5/01  9:13 PM  in a bit of a pinchy, gropey, pokey mood
                                  tonight? hmmm?

Kaori-Chan 11/5/01  9:13 PM  heehee yeah... you bizzy?

AV         11/5/01  9:14 PM  only if I want to make any progress...
                                  otherwise, not particularly ::a wan smile::

Kaori-Chan 11/5/01  9:14 PM  what are you sayin'?  ^.^ Want me to wander
                                  off?

AV         11/5/01  9:17 PM  eh... not really... I am just feeling really
                                  edgy... like time is not on my side, if you
                                  know what I mean
                                  I finally debugged my plot and stripped it
                                  down, but I haven't gotten it outlined so I'm
                                  kinda nervous about getting distracted
                                  ... and I could really use a good distraction,
                                  too! ::pouts::

Kaori-Chan 11/5/01  9:17 PM  well, up to you hon.  Was thinkin' of
                                  roleplaying, but I don't want to interrupt
                                  your work.

AV         11/5/01  9:20 PM  mmm... if you don't mind a bit of a delay in
                                  starting and occasional lapses on my part
                                  during, I might be up to playing
                                  
                                  I probably shouldn't, but I want to spend some
                                  time with you, and you'll probably be busy
                                  most of the week, right?

Kaori-Chan 11/5/01  9:20 PM  *nod nods* Hai, pretty busy methinks.

AV         11/5/01  9:21 PM  so, I'll have the rest of the week to obsess
                                  on writing, I only have to tie down a few
                                  threads so I don't forget everything, sound
                                  cool?

Kaori-Chan 11/5/01  9:21 PM  kk.  ^,^

Kaori-Chan 11/5/01  9:22 PM  I would write down a couple paragraphs of
                                  timeline, then expound BETWEEN them for
                                  future, then keep doing that till it starts
                                  looking like a story

AV         11/5/01  9:25 PM  the time line isn't really the big issue, it's
                                  the million and one different variations on
                                  the working themes that screws me up... that's
                                  the real problem with working with notes, they
                                  don't evolve or adapt and they tend to drag
                                  your mind back to what you were thinking when
                                  you first wrote them
                                  
                                  to offset my note archives I need a good,
                                  solid outline, or draft blocking to keep me
                                  straight while I am writing

AV         11/5/01  9:27 PM  NEway... do you have something to keep you
                                  busy for a short while?

Kaori-Chan 11/5/01  9:27 PM  that is an outline.  You type the beginning,
                                  and the end... and any important scenes that
                                  come to mind in the rough time they happen. 
                                  ^.^

Kaori-Chan 11/5/01  9:27 PM  for a little bit, yeah.  ^.^

AV         11/5/01  9:28 PM  okay... I'll hurry through this and get back
                                  to you, see you in a bit ::kiss::

Kaori-Chan 11/5/01  9:28 PM  ::Kiss fondle:: =)

AV         11/5/01  10:30 PM mmm... are you still there?

Kaori-Chan 11/5/01  10:31 PM yep.  ^>^

AV         11/5/01  10:32 PM I'm trying to get on irc... seems to be hung
                                  up on something...

Kaori-Chan 11/10/01 12:18 AM you dere?

AV         11/10/01 12:18 AM after a fashion... ::hugs::

Kaori-Chan 11/10/01 12:18 AM ::Hugs:: Busy?

AV         11/10/01 12:18 AM Yah... kinda...

Kaori-Chan 11/10/01 12:19 AM k... whatcha workin' on?

AV         11/10/01 12:20 AM same old... blocked out an outline, and now I
                                  am vetting my notes, preparing blocks to drop
                                  into the outline... it's looking rather
                                  promising, but most of it is a juggling act in
                                  my head ::rubs her temples::

AV         11/10/01 12:20 AM I can take a break and talk for a bit, though

AV         11/10/01 12:27 AM :;bangs head against keyboard:: sorry...
                                  system just crashed while I was saving...
                                  ::sigh::

Kaori-Chan 11/10/01 12:29 AM =( I'm sorry hon.  *hugs* I was just telling
                                  you to keep working before you crashed.

AV         11/10/01 12:29 AM mmm... as far as distractions go, this is a
                                  doozie... 

Kaori-Chan 11/10/01 12:31 AM *hugs* I was going to ask you if you wanted to
                                  RP some more, but I didn't want to interrupt
                                  you AGAIN when you were just getting to the
                                  writing part.

AV         11/10/01 12:32 AM thanks... I just checked and it looks like the
                                  important parts were saved okay... didn't lose
                                  any progress to my latest crash... I can't
                                  believe that trying to save caused it! brrrr!
                                  When *can* you be safe?

Kaori-Chan 11/10/01 12:33 AM *Shrugs*

AV         11/10/01 12:34 AM well, we do what we can... 
                                  
                                  how are you doing, my love?

Kaori-Chan 11/10/01 12:34 AM I'm okay.  Pretty horny, but okay.  ^^;

AV         11/10/01 12:35 AM ::smiles and ruffles your hair:: Oooo... if I
                                  could just get my *hands* on you! I'm sure I
                                  could fix that! ::giggles::

Kaori-Chan 11/10/01 12:38 AM to be honest, I am mentally obsessing about
                                  this girl who is an RA at nerland... everyone
                                  calls her a slut and a bitch.
                                  
                                  Thing is... well... she wears tight shirts
                                  that show off cleavage.  She's of a stocky
                                  build and she has some rather impressive
                                  endowments.

AV         11/10/01 12:39 AM oh my... ::grins::

Kaori-Chan 11/10/01 12:40 AM maybe it's my mail side being dominant or
                                  something, but I like the idea that... rumor
                                  has it... she's an easy lay or some such. 
                                  ^^;;

AV         11/10/01 12:41 AM ::looks thoughtful:: I'm sure I don't need to
                                  comment on that... but, if you want to go
                                  after her, best of luck!

Kaori-Chan 11/10/01 12:42 AM I just want to sleep with her, not date her...
                                  ^^;  However unethical that sounds.
                                  
                                  

AV         11/10/01 12:46 AM well... if that's what you want, then you need
                                  to become her friend... girls who love sex
                                  will sometimes take on a guy who simply needs
                                  some training and experience... you don't want
                                  her to feel sorry for you, you want her to see
                                  you as someone who'd just like to play... a
                                  lot... until you're a real stallion... but
                                  that only works if you can establish something
                                  of a friendship...
                                  
                                  unless once, and only once, is all you're
                                  interested in...

Kaori-Chan 11/10/01 12:46 AM k.  *nod nods*

AV         11/10/01 12:48 AM in any case, you have my blessing... if it
                                  helps, you can tell her I'd consider it a big
                                  favor if she was *really* nice to you, since
                                  we're too far apart for me to break you in
                                  personally ::laughs::

Kaori-Chan 11/10/01 12:49 AM *Laughs* =)
                                  
                                  Thing is, not a lot of the people I hang
                                  around like her.  I see she's a bit of a,
                                  well, bitch about her job, but she's not a bad
                                  person.  Then again, I'm an optimist about
                                  people recently it seems.

AV         11/10/01 12:51 AM ::smiles:: working tends to bring out the
                                  worst in some people, who in any other
                                  circumstances are wonderful people... without
                                  knowing her, I can't really offer you any
                                  valuable insight

Kaori-Chan 11/10/01 12:51 AM *shrugs*
                                  
                                  Anyways... did you want to RP, or just talk
                                  some?

AV         11/10/01 12:55 AM I wanted to talk some... I'm not gonna be able
                                  to gear my mind for RP tonight, I'm sorry

Kaori-Chan 11/10/01 12:56 AM s'okay, don't be sorry.  ^>^

AV         11/10/01 12:56 AM I just hate ever having to say no to you... 

Kaori-Chan 11/10/01 12:57 AM hon, don't worry.  ^>^  I am typically only

AV         11/12/01 10:25 PM from Buffy the Vampire slayer

Kaori-Chan 11/12/01 10:27 PM never watched a single episode, but okay.
                                  
                                  how is the writing coming?

AV         11/12/01 10:28 PM obsessive compulsive absorbing as ever... I
                                  only paused long enough to go out and apply
                                  for a job at the local Blockbuster... and of
                                  course to watch 2 hours worth of Buffy, like I
                                  do M-F... 

Kaori-Chan 11/12/01 10:28 PM aaah, I see... but are you making significant
                                  progress, or is it just bouncing around
                                  incoherantly still?

AV         11/12/01 10:30 PM oh, there is much progress in fact... it's
                                  only relative to what I have to accomplish
                                  that it seems like I'm getting nowhere... I'm
                                  getting things done, my love... many much
                                  things

AV         11/12/01 10:32 PM that's good... I'm glad you are interested...
                                  I won't be shoving anything at you to read for
                                  a while, but... ::smiles:: getting a part time
                                  job will take a lot of pressure off of me, and

Kaori-Chan 11/12/01 10:34 PM ::Nod nods and hugs::

AV         11/12/01 10:36 PM I'm sorry this is sort of coming between us...
                                  at least when it comes to RP... but... I don't
                                  know, you're a writer, so maybe you don't need
                                  me to talk about how absorbing a writing
                                  project can become... do you put writing or RP
                                  first?

Kaori-Chan 11/12/01 10:39 PM ::Shrugs::  Homework first...
                                  
                                  RP, RP I like doing... even in spite of
                                  writing.  It's very addictive for me, which is
                                  why I generally have moved away from it,
                                  though I still like the occassional
                                  fun-making.
                                  
                                  Writing... well, my inspiration is directed at
                                  other things recently, so FC... is on hold,
                                  much as it has been for a while now.

AV         11/12/01 10:44 PM ah... well, aside from asserting my true self,
                                  my writing is my highest priority... the key
                                  to an independant income and lifestyle... you
                                  fit in under asserting my true self, so I do
                                  put you before writing in my heart, but I am
                                  forced to conceed that making you happy does
                                  not resolve the problems or meet the needs of
                                  my day to day life... so I feel bad when you
                                  want to RP and I'm in the middle or my work
                                  ::sighs and shakes her head::

Kaori-Chan 11/12/01 10:45 PM it's no problem, see, I want to roleplay right
                                  now, but if I was I wouldn't be writing my
                                  article that is slightly overdue.  ^^;

AV         11/12/01 10:48 PM ::smiles and nods:: Don't mind me, I am hyper
                                  conscious of how things appear... with most
                                  people, appearances are everything, so I'm
                                  always wary of being misunderstood or
                                  misread... in my life, just about everything I
                                  have ever *wanted* has been ruthlessly denied,
                                  so I got used to setting aside my wants and
                                  focusing on my needs... at times it makes me
                                  seem insensative to other people's wants

                                  and you come online... I'm like a dog with two
                                  bones!

Kaori-Chan 11/22/01 1:14 AM  aaah, so busy eh?

AV         11/22/01 1:17 AM  strangely enough... I can only sit at the
                                  computer when I'm in a mood to write these
                                  days... I can't tell you how guilty it makes
                                  me... if I stop to chat and play with you,
                                  part of me is all worked up over not sticking
                                  to my work... but it kills me to even think of
                                  brushing you off... apparently, I'm only good
                                  at multitasking in my head... when I have to
                                  do it with something in the world, I just
                                  choke!

Kaori-Chan 11/22/01 1:17 AM  ahh...

AV         11/22/01 1:18 AM  I often wish I could exist in seperate
                                  temporal spheres... that way I could have Mark
                                  Time, when I could always be there for you,
                                  and on a totally seperate track, World Time
                                  and Writing Time... etc!

Kaori-Chan 11/22/01 1:19 AM  oh well.

AV         11/22/01 1:19 AM  ::leans her head against your shoulder::

AV         11/22/01 1:20 AM  You usually have the hope of roleplaying on
                                  your mind when you have time to chat with
                                  me... that's not a complaint... that's just a
                                  feeling I have...

AV         11/22/01 1:21 AM  how much does ti bother you when I can't?

Kaori-Chan 11/22/01 1:21 AM  a lot.  Though only because there is little
                                  else to discuss at times... it always seems
                                  like you are busy without accomplishing
                                  anything... to be frank.

AV         11/22/01 1:22 AM  I suppose I ought to ask, how much does it
                                  mean to you? is it just your preferred
                                  activity for amusement, or is it, like, the
                                  high point of your day (or week) to be able to
                                  role play?

Kaori-Chan 11/22/01 1:22 AM  roleplaying? It's something I spend a lot of
                                  time doing when I get the chance.  How
                                  important do you think it is to me?

AV         11/22/01 1:25 AM  "t always seems like you are busy without
                                  accomplishing anything... to be frank."
                                  
                                  I can agree with that... and I guess my
                                  response to that fits in with your next
                                  question... my writing is very important to
                                  me... it's what keeps me going... it really
                                  bothers me how much work it involves and how
                                  it seems to accomplish nothing... but, it
                                  accomplishes a lot.
                                  

AV         11/22/01 1:26 AM  there are times when I have the feeling that
                                  roleplaying is sort of what keeps you going,
                                  when things re frustrating, the activity
                                  allows you to recharge and stay motivated

Kaori-Chan 11/22/01 1:28 AM  you've been talking for several months about
                                  how you've been working on outlines...  and
                                  repetitively, it seems like it is just an
                                  excuse, and perhaps you aren't even trying
                                  that hard.
                                  
                                  I take up.... maybe a day.... maybe two every
                                  two weeks since joining college, and STILL you
                                  haven't had significant movement in your
                                  writing, though I suspect you go out and see
                                  movies/help launce do things launce wants
                                  done/etc., which albeit not bad, doesn't
                                  really give me the impression you're going all
                                  out on the writing.
                                  
                                  And you brush me off, claiming important
                                  writing... and I nod, and say okay, and am
                                  fine with it.  But it's still a brush off,
                                  even if I am sympathetic with your writing.

AV         11/22/01 1:28 AM  I know... well, you've said, that I keep you
                                  going, that I've put a positive spin on your
                                  life... I expect it is a major bummer for you
                                  that I don't participate more in
                                  roleplaying... because, as you said, there is
                                  little enough for us to do together at
                                  present... I don't think either of us is big
                                  on small talk

AV         11/22/01 1:30 AM  our relationship is sustained by a fragil
                                  thread of contact...

Kaori-Chan 11/22/01 1:30 AM  I wouldn't be annoyed if it wasn't for the
                                  fact that you were more than willing to
                                  romance me into an intimate, love-making RP...
                                  but seem averse to anything else that might
                                  take away your time.
                                  
                                  Or was I reading you wrong?

AV         11/22/01 1:36 AM  I don't think you are reading me completely
                                  wrong... I suspect that I am very selfish,
                                  without consciously recognizing it, most of
                                  the time... I can't talk to you without
                                  feeling the need to devote my attention to
                                  you, and usually once I start chatting with
                                  you I cease to focus on anything but you... I
                                  just don't type fast enough to write and chat
                                  at the same time... 
                                  
                                  it means very little that I give you more than
                                  I give anyone else, when I take a step outside
                                  of myself you can't see that, and ultimately,
                                  I don't keep scores, if you know what I
                                  mean...

Kaori-Chan 11/22/01 1:37 AM  not really.

AV         11/22/01 1:40 AM  it means, when I give, I give freely and
                                  unconditionally... I don't expect anyone to
                                  notice or care or praise me for being a good
                                  person... I give what I can and ask for
                                  nothing in return... I cherish what I receive
                                  and demand nothing of anyone... if what I can
                                  give is not enough, I... it hurts, but I
                                  learned the hard way that you cannot give what
                                  you do not have...

Kaori-Chan 11/22/01 1:41 AM  Alex.... why should I believe this when I see
                                  you once in two weeks? I am not taking up a
                                  significant portion of your life.  Sorry.

AV         11/22/01 1:46 AM  you resent Launce for making demands of me,
                                  but I do not hesitate to give him whatever he
                                  wants, because I am simply grateful for the
                                  fact that he has provided me with support and
                                  shelter at a time in my life when... to be
                                  honest.. I am not able to provide for myself.
                                  
                                  I... I don't suppose it matters if you believe
                                  any of this... and you are right about how
                                  strained our relationship is... but, as much
                                  as I love you, I am not clinging to you, I am
                                  not holding you back... I don't own you, and I
                                  won't stop you if you try to leave me... right
                                  now, with things the way they are, I don't
                                  think I am worth holding on to... I will say
                                  this, I promised I would not leave you or
                                  forsake you... neither will I hold you back...

Kaori-Chan 11/22/01 1:48 AM  I am just angry at you, Alex.
                                  
                                  and I didn't say I resented Launce for asking
                                  you to do things.  I in fact said I feel you
                                  are using Launce as an excuse not to do your
                                  writing, which invalidates you using your
                                  writing as an excuse to neglect me.

                                  have a way of interfereing, and there is a lot
                                  of time I don't spend writing... there is a
                                  good amount of time I spend trying to be an
                                  active and useful member of the household I am
                                  in, and a good amount of time I spend doing
                                  nothing of significance just to keep my
                                  equlibrium

Kaori-Chan 11/22/01 1:54 AM  neither.
                                  
                                  You come on to me, I ask you if you would RP,
                                  you say no.
                                  
                                  Analyze that for me.

AV         11/22/01 1:57 AM  ah... well... I didn't realize I was coming on
                                  to you... that's juse me being me... I have a
                                  very sensual nature, and I was excited to be
                                  talking to you... you asked me if I was busy
                                  and I admitted that I was... and I decided to
                                  address your frustration over my...
                                  infidelity... when it comes to roleplaying...
                                  this whole thing got out of control at some
                                  point, because what I was trying to get at was
                                  this: Once I start writing, I hate to be
                                  pulled away from it... since there's little I
                                  can do to change that, I was going to suggest
                                  that maybe we need to pick a day for us to
                                  dedicate to roleplaying. That way I won't get
                                  into writing and I will be ready and eager to
                                  roleplay

Kaori-Chan 11/22/01 2:00 AM  okay...  misunderstanding.
                                  
                                  Still, though, everything I did say is still
                                  valid.

AV         11/22/01 2:03 AM  alright, and yes, it is... up to a point... I
                                  spend an avarage of 10 hours a day writing,
                                  usually into the wee hours of the morning...
                                  even with that much effort, it's slow going,
                                  and I am always feeling like I'm not getting
                                  enough done... and it's not easy to spend that
                                  much time on the computer... it kind of hurts
                                  that you think I am using my writing as an
                                  excuse to avoid you, and using anything else
                                  as an excuse to avoid writing... do you
                                  honestly believe that I am?

AV         11/22/01 2:04 AM  if that's the imprssion I am giving you, when
                                  we talk, then I have to be more careful not to
                                  use you to vent whatever frustrations I am
                                  having, because when I vent I am not that
                                  careful of what I say...

Kaori-Chan 11/22/01 2:05 AM  no, I try not to commit myself to any one
                                  opinion of something because I have a limited
                                  view from only my own perspective.
                                  
                                  However, I said it seems that way at times. 
                                  Does not mean it is, or that I think it is.
                                  
                                  

AV         11/22/01 2:10 AM  okay... now, as for roleplaying... I'll be
                                  honest, it is not someting I have much
                                  interest in at the moment... I have a great
                                  deal of interest in you, and that's my
                                  motivation for playing... and I don't mean I
                                  don't like roleplaying, but that it's
                                  something I can do without... like reading or
                                  going to parties or any of a number of
                                  activities I like that I have to put aside so
                                  I can concentrate on trying to get my life in
                                  order... that's simply a matter of
                                  priorities... which brings me to you... I
                                  honestly don't know where to put you in my
                                  priorities... my heart says first, my common
                                  sense says I need to deal with too many other
                                  things first
                                  ::shakes her head:: aside from feeling
                                  miserable and guilty, I still have to wonder

Kaori-Chan 11/22/01 2:11 AM  deal with your life... I have a life to deal
                                  with as well.  i am not on enough for you to
                                  put me first.

AV         11/22/01 2:15 AM  that sounds rational... and very mature... I
                                  think you deserve better than me... or if I
                                  really am something worth having, you deserve
                                  better than this situation... 

Kaori-Chan 11/22/01 2:16 AM  We choose our situations.

AV         11/22/01 2:17 AM  if that's so, then I think I hate myself for
                                  the choices that have brought the situation to
                                  this... 

Kaori-Chan 11/22/01 2:18 AM  I'm not dumping you, Alex.
                                  
                                  

AV         11/22/01 2:18 AM  I didn't think you were... I just... wanted to
                                  give you an easy way out if you needed it...

Kaori-Chan 11/22/01 2:20 AM  invariably, I am not bothered by much anymore.
                                   I struggle through indefinitely.

AV         11/22/01 2:24 AM  this is where I would hug you and hold on to
                                  you for as long as I could in silence, because
                                  that says more than I can put into words... 

Kaori-Chan 11/22/01 2:25 AM  ::Huggles::

AV         11/22/01 2:27 AM  you make me real, love... when I talk to you,
                                  all illusions just fall away, and I know who I
                                  am... I don't have to try to be me, with
                                  you... you draw me out

Kaori-Chan 11/22/01 2:28 AM  I don't give you illusions about myself.

Kaori-Chan 11/22/01 2:33 AM  Then say nothing.

AV         11/22/01 2:36 AM  I feel as if I've reached someplace warm and
                                  deep and comfortable in you... I don't feel
                                  the distance... you're here, and I can feel
                                  you... and it's everything... just that... no
                                  uncomfortable silence... no apprehension or
                                  discontent... 

Kaori-Chan 11/22/01 2:37 AM  ::Strokes your back::

AV         11/22/01 2:39 AM  this is what it would be like, to lie beside
                                  you, warm and safe in bed... no passion, no
                                  desire, no want... just comfort and
                                  closeness... like understanding, it needs no
                                  demonstration... timeless

AV         11/22/01 2:43 AM  Mark?

Kaori-Chan 11/22/01 2:44 AM  hai?

AV         11/22/01 2:45 AM  This is a wonderful moment, but reality is
                                  going to intride in a bit... I'm gonna have to
                                  wrap up what I was working on and shut down
                                  and go to bed, since I have to be up early for
                                  my ride... is there anything we need to sort
                                  out before I have to go? do you want to name a
                                  day for role playing?

Kaori-Chan 11/22/01 2:46 AM  what day would be best for you?

AV         11/22/01 2:48 AM  any day but Fri and Sat in the evenings...
                                  those are the only days when conflicts might
                                  come up, at least until I get a job... still
                                  haven't heard back on that...

Kaori-Chan 11/22/01 2:48 AM  dunno then...

AV         11/22/01 2:50 AM  the main thing is, I need to know before I get
                                  on the computer so I don't start writing...
                                  it's the interruption thing that throws me
                                  off... I just need some advance notice

Kaori-Chan 11/22/01 2:52 AM  ah... we'll have to talk about it...

AV         11/22/01 2:53 AM  okay... we'll work something out... I don't
                                  want to shut you out, or brush you off...
                                  ever...

Kaori-Chan 11/22/01 2:54 AM  *Nod nods*  I am just very busy, and see you
                                  very rarely.

Kaori-Chan 11/25/01 1:35 PM  =)

AV         11/25/01 1:36 PM  did you have a fun Thanksgiving?

AV         11/25/01 1:36 PM  did you at least have an *edible*
                                  Thanksgiving?

Kaori-Chan 11/25/01 1:37 PM  yeah, I ate a bit, even though I didn't sleep
                                  at all and had to return to my room to go
                                  unconscious after only two hours.
                                  
                                  How was yours?

AV         11/25/01 1:41 PM  had to get up early to catch my ride, spent
                                  hours in traffic getting there, waited hours
                                  for food, discovered that one plateful was too
                                  much (but at least it was good), drank
                                  Martinelli's instead of wine... passed out a
                                  half an hour after dinner... and wait! there's
                                  more!

AV         11/25/01 1:44 PM  when I woke up I got to sit around for several
                                  hours while everyone argued about who had to
                                  sleep where and in the end I still had to go
                                  over to my sister's apartment and spend the
                                  night with her... um, let's just say that her
                                  place is really messy and her sleep schedule
                                  is more messed up than mine... we got back to
                                  my parents after noon the next day, and I
                                  spent the rest of the day wondering if I was
                                  getting a ride home or if I'd be stuck out
                                  there for another night... finally I crashed
                                  and my brother decided he wanted to go home,
                                  so I was woken up and spent an hour or so in
                                  the car coming home...

Kaori-Chan 11/25/01 1:45 PM  ^^;;;
                                  
                                  So.... it wasn't all that fun of a holiday for
                                  you, hmm beloved?

AV         11/25/01 1:53 PM  No... in some ways, I suppose not... there's a
                                  big difference between appreciation and
                                  satisfaction, I have found that I truly
                                  appreciate the people who have been a part of
                                  my life, even my brother, Mike, who hates me
                                  because I told him the truth about me and he
                                  can't deal with it... ::shakes her head::
                                  family holidays have always been painful

                                  expect they ever will... but they do love me,

Kaori-Chan 11/25/01 2:09 PM  ::Kisses you gently:: Not a problem, dear one.

AV         11/25/01 2:10 PM  are you back at school or... did you go home
                                  for the whole weekend... or, where are you?

Kaori-Chan 11/25/01 2:11 PM  in my room, of course.  At home... I call
                                  campus home because it's where I am myself
                                  without parents.

AV         11/25/01 2:15 PM  ah... okay... are you going to be on the
                                  computer all afternoon? 
                                  !!!!! 
                                  ah... it seems I have another admirer...
                                  ::looks at other window:: um... he's *licking*
                                  me... hmmm... what do you suppose he wants?
                                  ::raises her eyebrow::

Kaori-Chan 11/25/01 2:16 PM  huh?

AV         11/25/01 2:17 PM  someoeone I met on irc... on megatokyo... he's
                                  been chasing me for cyber... but he was not
                                  interested in HRP... he pops in every now and
                                  then to flirt with me

Kaori-Chan 11/25/01 2:19 PM  aaaaaaah....  and what do you think about
                                  that? =)

AV         11/25/01 2:20 PM  I think it's nice to have someone to play
                                  with... but I get the impression that people I
                                  play with get addicted to me... I just can't
                                  type fast enough to keep up with a hoard of
                                  admirers!

Kaori-Chan 11/25/01 2:22 PM  heh.  =)

AV         11/25/01 2:25 PM  I'm trying to find out if I've cybered with
                                  this guy or if there was just flirting and
                                  such... it's embarrassing that I can't
                                  remember! ::blushes::

Kaori-Chan 11/25/01 2:25 PM  ::Nuzzles::

AV         11/25/01 2:27 PM  ah... just flirting... I remember he was
                                  flirting with me when I was trying to get in a
                                  RP with you, and I invited him to join us and
                                  he sort of quailed at the thought of Hentai
                                  with a couple of guys (meaning you and Roland)

AV         11/25/01 2:32 PM  um... ::nuzzles:: when it comes to chatting
                                  with more than one person, I really do prefer
                                  irc... ::sighs:: 

Kaori-Chan 11/25/01 2:32 PM  aaah... you asking me to join IRC?

AV         11/25/01 2:33 PM  um... I would, if I thought I could get patch
                                  monkey to join us... 

Kaori-Chan 11/25/01 2:34 PM  well, I'm on IRC anyways.  *Shrugs*  

AV         11/25/01 2:35 PM  well... he just kicked off... he does that...
                                  spits out two lines... 
                                  
                                  I'm tired
                                  /me goes to sleep
                                  (and logs off before I can reply, Every Time!)

AV         11/25/01 2:36 PM  as for that... I'm not surprised... I probably
                                  would have suggested meeting on a different
                                  server though... 

Kaori-Chan 11/25/01 2:37 PM  ???????
                                  
                                  Huh??

AV         11/25/01 2:40 PM  patch monkey is part of the MegaTokyo crowd...
                                  the irc.megatokyo.com server is U.S. based,
                                  english and japanese language, anime-manga fan
                                  oriented... and I can get on it... that's

Kaori-Chan 11/25/01 2:40 PM  I'm on starchat now.  ^.^

AV         11/25/01 2:41 PM  no doubt... I'll be there in a sec

Kaori-Chan 11/25/01 9:22 PM  herroo?

Kaori-Chan 11/25/01 9:41 PM  hellooooooooo?

Kaori-Chan 11/25/01 9:59 PM  aleeex, where are youuuuu?

AV         11/25/01 10:16 PM sorry sorry sorry... totally lost track of the
                                  time!  waaaahhh!

Kaori-Chan 11/25/01 10:17 PM s'okay.  Took some initiative to fiddle with
                                  some of my MOO descriptions, which I haven't
                                  fooled with in 7 months.

AV         11/25/01 10:18 PM the clock on the VCR was an hour off... the
                                  movie that started during dinner just ended
                                  and I found out what time it really was...
                                  eeep...

Kaori-Chan 11/25/01 10:19 PM don't worry about it hon.  Not upset.  ^.^

AV         11/25/01 10:20 PM that's good... I was worried... I say I'm
                                  gonna be good for once and instead I flake...
                                  aaaagh... ::giggles::

AV         11/25/01 10:22 PM so, what did you want to play tonight?

Kaori-Chan 11/25/01 10:22 PM well, a variation on our last one perhaps.

AV         11/25/01 10:24 PM variation in what sense? what's different?

Kaori-Chan 11/25/01 10:26 PM well, I'll play some of the other characters
                                  for one... and for two, Kaoru is intangible,
                                  and what effects reality is her notepad.  =)

AV         11/25/01 10:27 PM *her* notepad? or was that a typo?

Kaori-Chan 11/25/01 10:28 PM urrr.. no, why?

AV         11/25/01 10:29 PM um... just a bit confused, love... I'm used to
                                  Kaoru being a male alias and Kaori being the
                                  female version... you used Kaoru and *her* in
                                  the same sentence, sort of threw me ::smiles::

Kaori-Chan 11/25/01 10:30 PM Kaoru is a gender neutral name, hence Kamiya
                                  Kaoru from Kenshin.... Kaori is a female name.
                                  
                                  

AV         11/25/01 10:31 PM oh... so, in this version Kaoru is a girl, and
                                  sort of a ghost who can influence the
                                  character's reality...?

AV         11/25/01 10:32 PM note to self: that should have been a plural
                                  possessive, not singular... sigh

Kaori-Chan 11/25/01 10:32 PM yeah, but not a ghost... just chooses
                                  ephemeralness.

AV         11/25/01 10:34 PM mmm... does that mean the characters know her,
                                  you know, like a school acquaintence?

AV         11/25/01 10:37 PM I'm closing this, now that we're both on
                                  irc...

Kaori-Chan 11/26/01 1:13 AM  oops, got disconnected from starchat
                                  

AV         11/26/01 1:13 AM  ah... I'll wait for you to come back

Kaori-Chan 11/26/01 1:13 AM  what server are you on?

AV         11/26/01 1:14 AM  nexus.starchat.net

AV         11/26/01 1:15 AM  do I need to repost anything?

Kaori-Chan 11/26/01 1:16 AM  if it was only Dai's first post, no, if it was
                                  more, yes.

Kaori-Chan 11/29/01 11:55 AM Thweep.

AV         11/29/01 11:55 AM HI ::hugs::

Kaori-Chan 11/29/01 11:56 AM ::huggles::  ^.^

AV         11/29/01 11:56 AM did you just wake up?

Kaori-Chan 11/29/01 11:57 AM nah, been awake a while now.  =)

AV         11/29/01 11:59 AM ah... ::smiles:: 

Kaori-Chan 11/29/01 11:59 AM Listening to "Stones" From "Ultima: Ascension"
                                  
                                  or... actually, Stones from Ultima's 4-9.  =)

AV         11/29/01 12:00 PM mmm... I don't have a clue what that is...
                                  isn't that sad?

Kaori-Chan 11/29/01 12:02 PM Ultima was the original roleplaying game for
                                  computers.  Akalabeth was the first game,
                                  later made into Ultima.
                                  
                                  The grand-daddy of all C-RPG's.  =)
                                  
                                  the most beloved ultima's involved the Avatar,
                                  a person who represented the ideals of the 7
                                  virtues... (Humility, Compassion, Valor,
                                  Honor, Sacrifice, and Spirituality).
                                  
                                  Ultima XI ended the saga of the Avatar.  It
                                  also had a kick ass score of music, which
                                  shipped with the collectors edition of the
                                  game.

AV         11/29/01 12:04 PM I assumed that was what you were talking
                                  about, it's just that I haven't actually
                                  played any of the Ultima games or heard any of
                                  the music... at least not consciously ::grin::

Kaori-Chan 11/29/01 12:04 PM "Stones" Was composed by Iolo, the bard, who
                                  was one of the original companions of the
                                  Avatar when he went on his quest for
                                  enlightenment (Ultima 4).
                                  
                                  Richard Garriot, the person who designed the
                                  Ultima games, is also known as "Lord British",
                                  who is the King over all Brittania.  Lord
                                  British is also in all the Ultimas.

AV         11/29/01 12:05 PM mmm... ::nods her head sagely... then
                                  giggles::

Kaori-Chan 11/29/01 12:06 PM Ultima has a lot of nostalgia for a great deal
                                  of people.  They are a part of my childhood
                                  and my growing up which was very special to
                                  me... that, and the Sierra brand of games like
                                  King's Quest and Quest for Glory.
                                  
                                  *Smiles* Why are you laughing?

AV         11/29/01 12:08 PM laughter inspired by silly posing... on my
                                  part... guess who got up *unusually* early for
                                  once... speaking in relative terms...

AV         11/29/01 12:16 PM hmmm.... of course the question is... who was
                                  wearing it when you took it off...? if you
                                  just stripped me... let me say "eeeeek!" if
                                  you stripped if off you... let me say

AV         11/29/01 12:20 PM job interview, silly! I've been suffering from
                                  a serious cash deficiency this past month...

Kaori-Chan 11/29/01 12:21 PM I know it's a job interview.  ^>^
                                  
                                  What Job?

AV         11/29/01 12:26 PM This will probably be the job at Block Buster
                                  I applied for over a week ago... apparently
                                  they had their busiest day the day after I
                                  applied (set a record in the ocmpany, they
                                  claim) and lost my application... I have to go
                                  in and give them my SSN so they can pull it
                                  out of the computer and look at it...

                                  we went by earlier...)

Kaori-Chan 11/29/01 3:21 PM  kk.  *Hugs and kisses* Love you lots, Alex...

Kaori-Chan 11/30/01 3:28 PM  ::Snuggles::

Kaori-Chan 12/4/01  7:36 AM  there was a dream I had... once... oh, so
                                  horrible and sorrowful.  It was a beautiful
                                  dream, full of hope and promise.
                                  
                                  And betrayal.  Full of pain and longing.
                                  
                                  
                                  And worse... worse than so much murder.

Kaori-Chan 12/4/01  7:41 AM  In that dream, I was... and am... much as I
                                  am.  A normal marcus, a peaceful plain.  In
                                  that dream I lived, and loved, and found
                                  myself a part of man.
                                  
                                  In that dream... like a dying candle, like a
                                  burning ember in the cyclone of heat rising
                                  from a once beautiful fire, you fell into it. 
                                  A beautiful, lonely girl who could be nothing
                                  more than perfection embodied.
                                  
                                  

Kaori-Chan 12/4/01  7:41 AM  A girl with strange powers, and compassion
                                  beyond measure.  So soft voiced, so
                                  pristine...
                                  
                                  I took you in, cared deeply for you, nurtured
                                  you back to health.  You told me there had
                                  been a long journey, that you remember me, all
                                  to the response of puzzlement.
                                  

Kaori-Chan 12/4/01  7:41 AM  Then, strange things began happening.  Cars,
                                  people dressed suspiciously, looking for you,
                                  it felt like.  Searching with guns, scouring
                                  with a mission I wasn't familiar with.
                                  
                                  We fled... a string of people I knew, had come
                                  to know, scattered across the country.  Across
                                  the world.  Running, evermore... time flowed,
                                  and there was such sadness in your eyes.

Kaori-Chan 12/4/01  7:43 AM  I could look into your eyes and see eternity
                                  reflected back upon my soul, gazing deep and
                                  horrible into me with such a longing for love
                                  that it tore me apart.  I promised to protect
                                  you.
                                  
                                  My friends, all around the world, began to
                                  know you... to see you, to love you.  They
                                  began to organize around you, searching,
                                  yearning for answers as to why someone would
                                  want you, who these people were...
                                  
                                  

Kaori-Chan 12/4/01  7:44 AM  Then, small memories of... possibility. 
                                  Somewhere with answer, all the while you were
                                  telling me that you only had so much time, so
                                  much time that you could feel sifting through
                                  your fingers... through my fingers.
                                  
                                  Rushing, I took you to that place... searching
                                  as my heart was ripped out, a strange facility
                                  that wasn't military, no, was something...
                                  timeless, ageless, forever like you.
                                  
                                  

Kaori-Chan 12/4/01  7:50 AM  You said we were looking for an archive of
                                  books, and while we searched I found so many
                                  puzzling, confusing things... papers, scrolls,
                                  legends, prophecy about dragon.  About
                                  destruction and cycle.  Prophecies about a
                                  cycle of pain, winding down through to the end
                                  of time, a curse on humanity for something
                                  they did....
                                  
                                  

Kaori-Chan 12/4/01  7:51 AM  Papers on love, and power, and energy, and so
                                  much that it didn't matter then.  It didn't
                                  matter at all then, you were telling me that
                                  you had to go, there was no more time.  You
                                  sounded so distant, so fucking lost...
                                  
                                  I found the archive, just as you were
                                  vanishing... my answers gone, my answers never
                                  to be.  My love lost, profoundly shattered.
                                  

Kaori-Chan 12/4/01  7:51 AM  For a long, long time I cried...  cried for
                                  half the night.  I numbly left, I couldn't
                                  bear looking at the place for one more moment.
                                  
                                  

Kaori-Chan 12/4/01  7:51 AM  Following the trail of strange sightings led
                                  me to a military base, at least I think it
                                  was, which my friends had found, half of it
                                  submerged in an icy flood.  Somehow, I walked
                                  in throug the freezing water, uncaring...
                                  
                                  Then I saw a few of my friends explaining to
                                  the forces in that base exactly what had been
                                  going on, and for some reason it all made
                                  sense.

Kaori-Chan 12/4/01  7:52 AM  It was something to do with humanity finding
                                  out the full truth of the genetic code, and
                                  for some reason all of this was involved. 
                                  Maybe... maybe it was that some people were
                                  afraid of the truth, afraid of what you were
                                  destroying what they had so arrogantly come to
                                  rely upon, as if it was the only way they
                                  could live! Greed, GREED....

Kaori-Chan 12/4/01  7:54 AM  In that moment, I found myself full of some
                                  mysterious power... full of hate, and wrath,
                                  and hurt... knowing somehow, something had
                                  brought you to me, and they had... deleted
                                  that something, destroyed it, I don't know....
                                  
                                  I wanted to destroy them, I think maybe I did.
                                   I think maybe I have a thousand times on down
                                  the cycle, for being... I....
                                  
                                  *Sighs, going off by himself*

Kaori-Chan 12/5/01  11:21 AM are you there?

AV         12/5/01  11:21 AM To add a comment on the "evils" of
                                  technology... Internet service went down for a
                                  few days... I was here, but I could not reach
                                  you... ::hugs::

AV         12/5/01  11:23 AM I hope I am getting through now... ::holds you
                                  tight::

Kaori-Chan 12/5/01  11:24 AM you are.  I was wondering what happened
                                  because I didn't even see Launce online, so I
                                  was a bit worried.

AV         12/5/01  11:25 AM yeah... service in California, Washington and
                                  Oregon crashed and it took a while to come
                                  back on... I am not sure if it was just the
                                  cable networks we're on, or more... doesn't
                                  matter past our local provider, that's all it
                                  takes to cut us off

AV         12/5/01  11:26 AM I received your "dream/nightmare" posts in a
                                  flood... when did you send that?

Kaori-Chan 12/5/01  11:26 AM yeah, that whole dream thing was something i
                                  felt I had to get down before I forgot it.

Kaori-Chan 12/5/01  11:26 AM about two or three days ago.

AV         12/5/01  11:27 AM ::shudders:: wow... I am really sorry I wasn't
                                  there to respond to that... you must have been
                                  really worried!

Kaori-Chan 12/5/01  11:27 AM for a while, frantic.  Tried staying calm,
                                  since I was sure there was a reason why you
                                  weren't around.

AV         12/5/01  11:31 AM ::nods, holding you close to her heart:: 
                                  
                                  that must have been hard after a dream like
                                  that.. mmm... the worst thing was, while
                                  internet service was out, our household
                                  plumbing blew up, so we didn't have water for
                                  the past four days either... ack!

Kaori-Chan 12/5/01  11:31 AM That must have sucked.   ^>^

AV         12/5/01  11:33 AM actually, it still does... the problem has not
                                  been fixed, so we can only turn on the water
                                  for long enough to wash dishes and make a
                                  quick run on the toilets! 
                                  
                                  the other side of the internet problem... my
                                  application was in transit via email, so it
                                  was stalled until today... I have to start all
                                  over and go in for another interview today...
                                  but it sounds like just a formality, I think I
                                  have the job, they told me I'd be in
                                  orientation from 4 to 8

Kaori-Chan 12/5/01  11:35 AM KK... well, sounds like you're going to  have
                                  more money than I do for christmas.  ^>^

AV         12/5/01  11:37 AM dunno... most jobs take three to four weeks to
                                  get a first paycheck... I might have to get a
                                  loan from Launce to do my Christmas shopping
                                  ::giggles:: still, it will be nice to have a
                                  bit of cash flow... I don't spend much, but I
                                  can't get by with nothing... sorry to hear
                                  you're strapped for cash... this is a bad time
                                  of year to be broke!

Kaori-Chan 12/5/01  11:38 AM I have no money.  At all.  I can't even buy my
                                  three nephews gifts.

AV         12/5/01  11:39 AM awww... well, at least you don't need to worry
                                  about getting me anything, as long as we can
                                  just stay in contact, I am happy enough just
                                  being able to talk to you! ::hugs you tight::

Kaori-Chan 12/5/01  11:40 AM I do feel bad about not being able to get
                                  anyone ANYTHING.... it's just so incredibly
                                  frustrating.

AV         12/5/01  11:43 AM I know... the only way I am going to get
                                  thrugh christmas is because my family is so
                                  big we draw names... I only have to get one
                                  present, though I still feel obligated to get
                                  something for my parents and my neice, and of
                                  course the people I am living with... there's
                                  really only one gift I could give you, and it
                                  would be a gift for me too, but I dont have
                                  the feeling I am gonna manifest over
                                  christmas... ::sigh::

Kaori-Chan 12/5/01  11:45 AM hey, don't be so negative.  =)  It's a magical
                                  time of year.

AV         12/5/01  11:46 AM one sec... gotta turn off the water... then
                                  I'll respond to that

AV         12/5/01  11:53 AM back... I did not mean to sound negative... I
                                  don't have any sense that I won't pull it off,
                                  I just don't have a feeling of anticipation...
                                  during the holidays I tend to focus on making
                                  things happen and being positive... it might
                                  be a good thing that I am not feeling all
                                  worked up this year

Kaori-Chan 12/5/01  11:56 AM ::Snuggles::

AV         12/5/01  11:56 AM that reminds me... a while ago we had a long
                                  discussion about my writing... you were
                                  telling me you felt I never seemed to be
                                  getting anywhere with it... I've been thinking
                                  about that... and in a sense you were right...
                                  I've been writing a great deal, but the truth
                                  is, I am holding back on committing myself to
                                  it...

AV         12/5/01  11:57 AM I mean, think about it... if I put the writing
                                  first, focus on completing the book, how much
                                  time to you think it will take to finish it?

Kaori-Chan 12/5/01  11:57 AM depends.  See, with me, if I was focused and
                                  dedicated on fragile clay, I could finish the
                                  entire series in three years...
                                  
                                  I type that damn fast.

AV         12/5/01  11:58 AM I could probably turn out two books a year
                                  (and the story currently spans about six) if I
                                  made a total committment to it... do you or I
                                  want to wait that long, or longer, before I
                                  can resolve whatever issues I need to to
                                  assert my true self?

Kaori-Chan 12/5/01  11:59 AM Not fair to ask me.  What do YOU want?

AV         12/5/01  12:03 PM I want me, me, ME, ME, ME! *ahem* that's all I
                                  want... I write because it keeps me sane,
                                  and... I'd like to be able to say that I tried
                                  to create something to benefit others, but...
                                  I can't honestly put writing a book before
                                  trying to live my own life... I suppose, I
                                  don't want any conflict between writing and
                                  the freedom to be myself

Kaori-Chan 12/5/01  12:04 PM ::Snuggles closely::

AV         12/5/01  12:06 PM there are a lot of parallels between my
                                  writing and my pursuit of autonomy... in both
                                  cases I am willing to take as much time as
                                  necessary to get it done right... but I look
                                  at you sitting there alone, wishing we were
                                  together, and I get... I want to do it all NOW
                                  and spare you any waiting...

Kaori-Chan 12/5/01  12:07 PM Alex, I don't matter in this... if I am
                                  somehow making you frantic to get this done,
                                  it could very well be the thing holding you
                                  back.

AV         12/5/01  12:08 PM I will admit, finding you and loving you has
                                  been a test... but I think we can both point
                                  to evidence that shows that I can keep my
                                  perspective and calm dealing with you, and not
                                  be crippled by any passion for you... in some
                                  ways I am too composed for my liking...

AV         12/5/01  12:11 PM I think of you as an asset... as much as I
                                  need to do this for myself, I can honestly say
                                  I am not just doing it for myself... this is
                                  important for you, too

Kaori-Chan 12/5/01  12:12 PM ::Nods:: but am I a distraction from that
                                  goal? Do I keep you from advancing because you
                                  are frenetic about doing this for me as well
                                  as for you?

AV         12/5/01  12:16 PM ::shakes her head:: you only distract me in
                                  the moment, and that only from time to time
                                  because I stop what I am doing to spend time
                                  with you... if that's an obstacle, than life
                                  itself is standing in my way, and that simply
                                  cannot be... this needs to be done in the
                                  embrace of life, otherwise it's just a dream
                                  
                                  I think I am being held back because I have to
                                  work it all out in life, in time and space, by
                                  building a foundation... the only precedent
                                  for what I am doing is what I do... I've been
                                  building that foundation all my life, and
                                  you've helped me to pull it together and
                                  attend to details I overlooked...

AV         12/5/01  12:16 PM I have to go for a bit... need to work on the
                                  plumbing

Kaori-Chan 12/5/01  12:17 PM heehee, in a different context, that would be
                                  kinky.  =)

AV         12/5/01  12:46 PM ::comes back and sees your reply:: Whaa!!!
                                  ::blush, slap:: Oooooo!... um... well, yeah!

                                  okay, I am back in a limited capacity...
                                  ::smiles::

Kaori-Chan 12/5/01  12:47 PM just saw Nita online...  I am upset at her.  I
                                  loaned her $225 eight months ago, and haven't
                                  seen even a dollar paid back.  I needed that
                                  money for college, and I won't have it.

AV         12/5/01  12:49 PM mmm... there's a rule about loaning friends
                                  money... I had a very good friend who I bailed
                                  out of jail, sold a computer on credit, and
                                  helped pay for his marriage... he owed me over
                                  a thousand dollars... I mentioned it once, and
                                  I never heard from him again...

Kaori-Chan 12/5/01  12:50 PM yeah.  I would like to think that people
                                  aren't so callous and uncaring.
                                  
                                  I am really miffed about the situation right
                                  now.

AV         12/5/01  12:50 PM I wasn't even being nasty about it... he was
                                  bragging about how he had this great job and
                                  that he could get computers for free... I
                                  mentioned that if he got me one, I'd cancel
                                  his debt... 

AV         12/5/01  12:51 PM well, you have my sympathy, and I hope it
                                  doesn't destroy your friendshp with her...
                                  then again, you might not get over it... it's
                                  hard to turn the other cheek...

AV         12/5/01  12:53 PM just remember that in the final analysis,
                                  money isn't worth anything... it's just a
                                  point system designed to encourage social
                                  intercourse and keep a civilization stable...
                                  it's the interaction between people that gives
                                  it value... if $225 destroys your friendship,
                                  it's costing you alot more than a few days
                                  work...

Kaori-Chan 12/5/01  12:53 PM the thing is, she makes me feel like I am
                                  supposed to feel guilty for asking.... 
                                  probably not on purpose.
                                  
                                  Frankly, I don't care how many jobs she's
                                  working, it would seem with more jobs she'd be
                                  able to give me a ten dollar bill once in a
                                  while to work towards it.

Kaori-Chan 12/5/01  12:55 PM it isn't the money.  It is the principal of
                                  trusting someone with something and then
                                  learning you can't.

AV         12/5/01  12:57 PM ::takes your hand:: you know it isn't about
                                  money... owing someone money is a lot harder
                                  on the psyche than owing someone an apology
                                  for a wrong you didn't commit... our emotions
                                  are incapible of understanding money, it's too
                                  artificial... yes, you need the money, bacause
                                  it greases the wheels of a society too
                                  immature to value you as a person... and it
                                  puts you on the spot... but... if she is not
                                  in a position where she can pay you back in
                                  full without flinching... she's probably still
                                  in a tight spot herself

AV         12/5/01  12:59 PM the mistake people make about money is giving
                                  it value over people... you'd be better off
                                  writing the debt off and accepting that you
                                  have given a gift that cost you, but... true
                                  gifts have a price... don't let the price of
                                  this one be too high ::rubs your shoulder::

Kaori-Chan 12/5/01  12:59 PM I understand this, but it isn't fair to me for
                                  her to ruin my life just because hers is.
                                  
                                  I need money to go to college.  It would kill
                                  me to get a day job that would trap me for the
                                  rest of my life at this point in my life.
                                  
                                  I don't have money, I don't go to college, I
                                  am put to work doing something like the mail
                                  route, which would grind down my soul until I
                                  am not the person I am now.

Kaori-Chan 12/5/01  1:01 PM  I know that, Alex.
                                  
                                  I am a generally laid back sort of guy.  I can
                                  write it off, and I am willing to do that, but
                                  only if she's honest enough to admit she won't
                                  pay me.  I am not attached to money, I am
                                  attached to honesty.

AV         12/5/01  1:01 PM  believe me, I understand that... it's the
                                  position we are all in... I can say, quite
                                  literally, that I've never had a job that
                                  didn't come close to killing me... I'm just
                                  saying, take a step back... Nita isn't the
                                  problem, it's the world we live in... you
                                  cared enough for her to help her out, even
                                  though you put your own survival at risk...
                                  you did a good thing... don't let this fucked
                                  up world make you regret that

Kaori-Chan 12/5/01  1:03 PM  Okay... here is the run down: I loan her money
                                  to pay for a car she no longer owns.  She
                                  tells me while working in Denali that she is
                                  saving money and will have some for me come
                                  beginning of semester (FALSE).  I am less
                                  upset over the money than I am that she keeps
                                  giving the insinuation she'll pay me but
                                  doesn't.  *Shrugs*

                                  RP?

AV         12/5/01  1:06 PM  reverse post... my reply was late...
                                  
                                  okay... we're getting closer to the point...
                                  back off just a bit more... if you look at it,
                                  she's in the same situation you are, looking
                                  at her situation and feeling that the
                                  necessity of making money to pay people, bills
                                  and expenses is lilable to kill her... the
                                  truth is not that she won't pay you, but that
                                  she's afraid she can't pay you... the more
                                  pressure you put on her, even just asking for
                                  honesty, adds to the pressure she's putting on
                                  herself... it becomes a survival question and
                                  when it comes to that, we're hard wired to put
                                  ourselves first... I am sure she wants to pay
                                  you... but after a whlie all she can see is
                                  the pressure, the anger and frustration that
                                  comes between you... in time that's all she
                                  sees, and she feels (FEELS) that there's
                                  nothing in the relationship worth saving, in
                                  which case, she is less inclined to care if
                                  she pays you back

Kaori-Chan 12/5/01  1:07 PM  I know that.

                                  personal sacrifice to make it work, and that
                                  takes maturity that most people don't have...

                                  we lose that part of ourselves... we can only

                                  is one song.  and "Falling for the First Time"
                                  is another.

AV         12/5/01  8:08 PM  I have "It's all been done" but not "Falling
                                  for the First Time"... though I do have "When
                                  I Fall"

Kaori-Chan 12/5/01  8:08 PM  that's probably it.

AV         12/5/01  8:13 PM  ::laughs:: maybe... I'm still 30 songs away
                                  from them... I only have 239 songs on my
                                  active play list... the other 200 are on
                                  CD-ROM... unless you count the 60 Gigs Launce
                                  has squirreled away somewhere!
                                  
                                  I usually only make it through the first 20
                                  songs in my playlist before I shut down...
                                  most times

Kaori-Chan 12/5/01  8:13 PM  heehee.  Thats a long playlist.

AV         12/5/01  8:15 PM  yeah... and the worst thing is I have about 20
                                  "No Title" songs... I still don't know what
                                  they are... I think the band name is on the
                                  directory, but it doesn't read that in the
                                  playlist

Kaori-Chan 12/5/01  8:16 PM  ^^;

AV         12/5/01  8:19 PM  hmmm... I think I am rambling...
                                  
                                  Oh, I went on a Nicole Kidman picture capping
                                  spree today... picked up about a hundred
                                  pictures of her... silly, huh?

Kaori-Chan 12/5/01  8:20 PM  heehee.  =D  Why did you do that?

AV         12/5/01  8:27 PM  oh my god!... I selected the files to count
                                  them... and accidentally opened them... all of
                                  them... talk about a flood! It crashed ICQ!

Kaori-Chan 12/5/01  8:28 PM  *LOL*
                                  
                                  Roland went AWOL again.

AV         12/5/01  8:29 PM  awww... that bum! anyway... I bet you can
                                  guess why I collect pictures of redheads...
                                  she's not a perfect ringer for me, but from
                                  some angles she's pretty close...

Kaori-Chan 12/5/01  8:29 PM  =)

AV         12/5/01  8:31 PM  yeah... well, you know how it is... visual
                                  aids can help in all sorts of things... since
                                  I can't just look in a mirror, I look for
                                  reflection else where... ::grin::

Kaori-Chan 12/5/01  8:32 PM  ::nod nods:: =)

AV         12/5/01  8:34 PM  mmm... ::leans against you:: I had this one
                                  picture that I edited painstakingly and used
                                  as my desktop for a year... it was a perfect
                                  "reflection" but I lost every copy of it when
                                  my system was destroyed by a virus...

Kaori-Chan 12/5/01  8:34 PM  gah... Rargh.

AV         12/5/01  8:35 PM  I still have a copy of the original image, but
                                  I don't know if I'll be able to do the editing
                                  part again... ::sighs:: so, I guess I
                                  concentrate on the real thing more, now

Kaori-Chan 12/5/01  8:35 PM  yeah, you should.  =)

AV         12/5/01  8:36 PM  ::smiles:: although, I have to say, after
                                  years of collecting pictures, I sort of
                                  developed a desire to pose for a *lot* of
                                  pictures once I *can* ::falls over laughing::

Kaori-Chan 12/5/01  8:37 PM  you would have the body of a goddess when you
                                  manifest.  Very droolworthy, most likely.  ^>^

AV         12/5/01  8:39 PM  and... ::she sits up, broad grin and
                                  glittering eyes:: I'm a total nudist and
                                  exhibitionist at heart... can you imagine me
                                  *not* posing for some *delicious* pictures!? 
                                  
                                  ::looks at you:: are you a decent
                                  photographer? ::licks her lips::

Kaori-Chan 12/5/01  8:40 PM  no, but I could learn to be.  =D
                                  
                                  

Kaori-Chan 12/5/01  8:41 PM  psssst.... you wanna RP?

AV         12/5/01  8:42 PM  ::smiles:: would be a good idea... we could
                                  make a lot of money that way, and no one would
                                  get hurt... a lot of hearts might get broken,
                                  but... ::evil grin:: not yours...
                                  
                                  of course, there's always that triplets
                                  thing...
                                  
                                  mmm... I've been lucky to get this much time
                                  with you... let's not start anything that
                                  might get interrupted

Kaori-Chan 12/5/01  8:43 PM  I want to RP that one with the MPC.  I don't
                                  mind pauses.

AV         12/5/01  8:44 PM  might end up being more than a pause... give
                                  me a few minutes to find out what the plans
                                  are...

AV         12/5/01  8:47 PM  okay... it looks like I might have an hour to
                                  start with... so, remind me which game you
                                  mean... I thought the MPC one we needed Roland
                                  for...

Kaori-Chan 12/5/01  8:48 PM  ehh, not really.  Ranma is sort of stuck on
                                  the roof brooding.

AV         12/5/01  8:49 PM  mmm... I'm not really in the right frame of
                                  mind for Nabiki... and Dai's still stuck as a
                                  guy in that one... ::taps her lip thoughtfully
                                  for a moment, thinking::

Kaori-Chan 12/5/01  8:50 PM  not in the right frame for Nabiki? You've been
                                  sounding pretty nabiki the last ten or so
                                  minutes.  ^>^

AV         12/5/01  8:51 PM  ::raises an eyebrow and looks at you::

Kaori-Chan 12/5/01  8:51 PM  what? ^^;

AV         12/5/01  8:53 PM  I just had a flash of what would happen if I'd
                                  had that bit of conversation with Nabiki...
                                  that's what came to mind when you said I
                                  sounded Nab-ish... I thought, nah, Nab's
                                  wouldn't get excited about posing... but she'd
                                  drool to get a goddess to pose nude for her!
                                  ::rolls over laughing::

Kaori-Chan 12/5/01  8:54 PM  heehee.....
                                  
                                  Yeah.
                                  
                                  We could do something else.

AV         12/5/01  8:57 PM  mmm... if you can think of a way to drop
                                  nyannichaun water on Dai in that game, I'll
                                  play... it'll give me a focus, next to which I
                                  could play Nabiki... I just... ::shrugs:: I'd
                                  need to be able to use Dai... it's up to you
                                  
                                  what other kind of game would interest you?

Kaori-Chan 12/5/01  8:58 PM  ehh... another evil kaoru one, with
                                  insubstantial.  hey, I actually thought that
                                  notepad thing was a great idea....

AV         12/5/01  8:59 PM  so did I... wanna take another go at it?

Kaori-Chan 12/5/01  8:59 PM  yeah... though not sure if I want to continue
                                  that Akane one at this moment.

AV         12/5/01  9:00 PM  we don't have to... we can have Nabiki show up
                                  and spend some time with onna-Dai

Kaori-Chan 12/5/01  9:00 PM  heh, true.

AV         12/5/01  9:01 PM  so? let's do it! ::licks her lips and
                                  grins...::

Kaori-Chan 12/5/01  9:01 PM  heehee... pick up where we left off then?

AV         12/5/01  9:02 PM  um... don't remember exactly where we left
                                  off... 

Kaori-Chan 12/5/01  9:03 PM  that's what logs are for.  ^>^

AV         12/5/01  9:03 PM  mmm... if I could open them while I was in
                                  irc!

AV         12/6/01  1:24 AM  DC'd again...

Kaori-Chan 12/12/01 7:32 PM  rowrf

Kaori-Chan 12/12/01 8:22 PM  helloooooooooooo......?

AV         12/12/01 10:07 PM sorry... was in the house keeping warm...
                                  ::smiles and hugs you::

Kaori-Chan 12/12/01 10:08 PM hi... how have you been hon?

AV         12/12/01 10:09 PM I've calmed down... made it through my work
                                  days, did some thinking about us...

Kaori-Chan 12/12/01 10:09 PM okay...  any conclusions?

AV         12/12/01 10:11 PM no conclusions, just some things to keep in
                                  mind when dealing with you... the problem I
                                  have with talking to you this way is that,
                                  well, it's just text... I end up reading too
                                  much into things, and I forget that there's
                                  more to you than what I see in HRP...

Kaori-Chan 12/12/01 10:12 PM yeah... that's just what I do online.  Well,
                                  when I'm not browsing websites.

AV         12/12/01 10:14 PM I'm trying to think of something more to
                                  say... 

AV         12/12/01 10:17 PM You might not believe this, but... you've had
                                  a big impact on me in the past six months...
                                  I'm just not sure how much of it is because of
                                  who you are or who I think, feel, you are...
                                  I'm not sure I can explain it

Kaori-Chan 12/12/01 10:17 PM I'm fairly certain who I am, and I'm pretty
                                  sure of who you are.
                                  
                                  Are you trying to say something else, though?

AV         12/12/01 10:22 PM I am not sure. The question I have been asking
                                  myself is, what do I really expect from you?
                                  What do you expect from yourself? 

AV         12/12/01 10:23 PM I think part of it is a simple mistake... if I
                                  look at you as a part of myself, what makes me
                                  whole, my expectations then reflect what I
                                  understand it will take for me to be whole...

Kaori-Chan 12/12/01 10:25 PM not sure I follow you, but alright.

AV         12/12/01 10:28 PM um... let's look at it this way, Rose was an
                                  exceptional person, and you doubted you would
                                  ever find someone who possessed all of the
                                  qualities she possessed, the grace, the poise,
                                  the strength of heart and character... did you
                                  ever think that would be too much to expect of
                                  anyone?

Kaori-Chan 12/12/01 10:31 PM It's not too much to expect from anyone. 
                                  However, exemplifying such ideals is a
                                  difficult task.
                                  
                                  

AV         12/12/01 10:34 PM ::nods:: you and I clicked, because we
                                  recognized, deep down, a connection so strong,
                                  so true... for me it was essential that I
                                  trust my instincts, because that was all I
                                  had... I don't know if I am Rose reborn or
                                  not. I try to just be myself and you seem to
                                  find that enough... I don't think I've been as
                                  fair to you

Kaori-Chan 12/12/01 10:35 PM I ask you to be true to yourself... though I
                                  also ask you to enjoy some of the things I do
                                  with you, it is not as polite as you make me
                                  out to be.

AV         12/12/01 10:42 PM I'll be honest, I am not sure I can enjoy
                                  hentai... maybe it's just the situation I am
                                  in, maybe it conflicts with things I have to
                                  do if I am to manifest my true self... what I
                                  do know is that my "objection" is on an
                                  instinctive level... playing is a choice, and
                                  right now I get the feeling that it is the
                                  wrong choice
                                  
                                  I've thought of asking you to try an
                                  experiment, to let me play the game from the
                                  perspective you usually do, having the
                                  control, and even that felt wrong...

AV         12/12/01 10:48 PM it might just be that I can't think of it as a
                                  game at all... the situations that come up in
                                  HRP are too close to the circumstances of my
                                  life... playing the game is sort of like
                                  pouring gasoline on the fire... it gets me
                                  worked up over what's happened to me in my
                                  life, and arouses the pain associated with my
                                  life

AV         12/12/01 10:51 PM I end up feeling too much empathy with the
                                  characters you are toying with... and it is
                                  that empathy that also discourages any
                                  interest on my part in messing with other
                                  people's lives, even if they are just
                                  characters in a game...

Kaori-Chan 12/12/01 10:51 PM every situation has and will happen.
                                  
                                  Whether roleplayed or not, the most horrendous
                                  things have already occurred... and otherwise,
                                  the most beautiful and glorious.
                                  
                                  both spectrums.

AV         12/12/01 10:54 PM all things are posible, but not all
                                  possabilities are good... free will comes in
                                  where those possabilities are explored... the
                                  key to what I am trying to accomplish in my
                                  own life is integrity and personal
                                  responsability... I have to live in the
                                  consciousness of every consequence of my own
                                  actions... those things may have their place,
                                  but it's not my place to help them happen

AV         12/12/01 10:54 PM what you do factors into what you are

Kaori-Chan 12/12/01 10:55 PM you saying something about me?

AV         12/12/01 10:56 PM I'm only saying what I know about being... the
                                  basic consequences of existence... I am not
                                  passing judgement

AV         12/12/01 10:57 PM I am bound by my own conscience... not by
                                  morals... I don't know what is right or what
                                  is wrong, I can only look at the consequences
                                  of my own actions...

AV         12/12/01 10:57 PM I cannot deny my own empathy... lest I deny
                                  myself

AV         12/12/01 10:58 PM that's where the problem comes in

AV         12/12/01 11:04 PM I am not saying that what you like to do,
                                  playing these games, is wrong, because that's
                                  about you and I don't have any say in that...
                                  for all I know, you are playing a necessary
                                  part in existence... that somewhere these
                                  things are real, and you are providing the
                                  impetus for these people to learn and grow...
                                  I know that there are such necessities in
                                  existence, and if you look at the world we
                                  live in, you can find the same kind of
                                  influences, on a subtler scale, affecting all
                                  of us

AV         12/12/01 11:07 PM I can say this, the role of adversity is by
                                  far a more demanding role to fill... it is
                                  something I had to understand to get to where
                                  I am... it's something I had to understand as
                                  a writer, for there are no stories without
                                  adversity...

Kaori-Chan 12/12/01 11:08 PM sure there is.  Genma's Daughter.

AV         12/12/01 11:09 PM which only serves to illustrate my point, for
                                  you are one of those who rejects the merits of
                                  that story

AV         12/12/01 11:09 PM the author of that peice could not bring
                                  herself to be ruthless enough to make the
                                  story real... so it is a whimsical, happy
                                  dream which does not satisfy it's promise

Kaori-Chan 12/12/01 11:11 PM I am a creature of conflict and balance,
                                  dictated by the annals of history.  Both a
                                  dark horse and a radiant image.

AV         12/12/01 11:12 PM I am a creature of creation and destruction,
                                  the beginning and end of things, and I am
                                  required to work with a delicate hand, lest
                                  nothing but chaos reigns

Kaori-Chan 12/12/01 11:13 PM I *AM* Chaos.

AV         12/12/01 11:14 PM the scary thing is, you're correct... that is
                                  your milieu

AV         12/12/01 11:17 PM the point is that order comes *through* you...
                                  without chaos there can be no order, without
                                  diversity, no unity

Kaori-Chan 12/12/01 11:18 PM of course.  I simply represent something
                                  opposite of what you do.  I am the stuff in
                                  between creation and destruction.

AV         12/12/01 11:21 PM Chaos is the champion of all things, the
                                  champion of souls without number, the primal
                                  sea of the Absolute... the stuff from which
                                  all creation and destruction resolves... and I
                                  am not your true opposite, unless I *am* the
                                  One... the rose, and the phoenix, represent
                                  the dynamic between chaos and order, the
                                  intercourse of souls, the embrace of unity and
                                  diversity... Paradox

AV         12/12/01 11:23 PM or maybe it is just that I, like you, am one
                                  of those things that can exist in the face of
                                  paradox...

AV         12/12/01 11:25 PM the phoenix is the eternal flame, always
                                  changing, always the same...

Kaori-Chan 12/12/01 11:25 PM mm... eternal flame...

AV         12/12/01 11:27 PM I am the champion of the individual,
                                  autonomous soul... an embodiment of self
                                  possession... I call for souls to recognize
                                  themselves and each other, to live, to dance,
                                  to dream... I am not "God"

AV         12/12/01 11:29 PM no one is mine to command, but I strive to
                                  inspire everyone... 

Kaori-Chan 12/12/01 11:30 PM *Nods*

AV         12/12/01 11:33 PM I am my own... I give myself to everyone, and
                                  as I am that which I give, I am responsible
                                  for sustaining myself, so ultimately, my
                                  autonomy is inescapable... 

AV         12/12/01 11:34 PM There are three perspectives that emerge from
                                  point paradox, however, one perspective
                                  bridges the other two, acting as a focus, an
                                  anchor. In a sense, that third perspective is
                                  eclipsed and divided by the other two,
                                  resulting in an expression of singular
                                  duality. The psyche becomes divided in the
                                  embrace and manifestation of that duality, a
                                  duality of soul and mind. 

AV         12/12/01 11:35 PM oops... ignore that... came off the clipboard
                                  from my writing...

AV         12/12/01 11:38 PM the phoenix and the dragon are archetypes of
                                  the Absolute, and thus are present in all
                                  absolutes, all souls... you and I... identify
                                  with those archetypes, and in striving to
                                  understand ourselves, we face the frightening
                                  conclusion that we *defined* those
                                  archetypes... 

Kaori-Chan 12/12/01 11:39 PM ::Nod nods::

AV         12/12/01 11:40 PM at one time, we did not discriminate between
                                  our selves and the One

AV         12/12/01 11:42 PM that changed when we became people... the
                                  personification of those archetypes... 

AV         12/12/01 11:45 PM in becoming me, I discovered the part of
                                  myself that you embodied best, my own dragon,
                                  my understanding of what it is to be a
                                  dragon... but it is not who I am, it is simply
                                  the key to being complete in and of myself...
                                  I suspect that is the same for you... you have
                                  the phoenix stamped into your soul, an
                                  understanding of me, a part of yourself you
                                  can call upon, but which does not reflect your
                                  true nature

Kaori-Chan 12/12/01 11:45 PM ::Nods::

AV         12/12/01 11:48 PM my life here on Earth has put me in touch with
                                  my dragon side... but my love for you has had
                                  me looking for you within myself... or hoping
                                  that understanding this dragon part of me, I
                                  understood you

AV         12/12/01 11:50 PM that was where I made a mistake with you...
                                  you are not me, as a dragon... you are the
                                  dragon, and I may never truly be able to
                                  understand you

                                  ribs and smiles::

Kaori-Chan 12/12/01 11:53 PM 1300 years is a long time to get to know
                                  eachother.  Human lifespans are not so kind.

AV         12/12/01 11:53 PM that might only be a scratch on the surface, I
                                  think we're both a lot older than that... 

Kaori-Chan 12/12/01 11:54 PM our souls are, yeah, but it's been a long
                                  seperation since that lifetime.

AV         12/12/01 11:55 PM is that supposed to be how long we lived
                                  together as Allen and Rose? or how long since
                                  we both died? if it's the second, a lot of
                                  interesting things must have happened during
                                  the dark ages... ::raises an eyebrow::

Kaori-Chan 12/12/01 11:56 PM allen and rose.  And they died quite a long
                                  while ago, in comparison to 1300 years.

AV         12/12/01 11:57 PM I thought so... the time for Atlantis ought to
                                  predate modern recorded history, though there
                                  was a period later when an Exodus occurred,
                                  when the Gaels left Earth...

Kaori-Chan 12/12/01 11:57 PM uhhhh... Gaels?

AV         12/12/01 11:57 PM Early Celts, or Gaels... I'm not sure which...

AV         12/12/01 11:58 PM any way, back to the topic...

AV         12/12/01 11:59 PM one thing I have been trying to work out...
                                  for me, in this life, my sole purpose has been
                                  to awaken and assert my true self... but... I
                                  don't know what is driving you

Kaori-Chan 12/12/01 11:59 PM You are driving me.  Aside from that... mm..
                                  
                                  Change.  I wish to make a difference.

AV         12/13/01 12:01 AM you seem to have a great deal more acceptance
                                  for the situation you are in than me, or else
                                  you never talk about your own intentions...
                                  you have an investment in being Mark... but as
                                  the Dragon, that might simply be an anchor, a
                                  refuge... I don't know...

Kaori-Chan 12/13/01 12:01 AM I personally would want to reflect my female
                                  side, however, I am not sure how.  I do not
                                  have the knowhow.

AV         12/13/01 12:02 AM do you have any ideas, of how it should be
                                  done?

AV         12/13/01 12:03 AM or are you just half asleep, waiting and
                                  dreaming?

Kaori-Chan 12/13/01 12:03 AM I have ideas of how it can be done, but I find
                                  myself too mentally incapable of achieving
                                  them.

AV         12/13/01 12:04 AM I know the feeling... it's like, you reach out
                                  your hand to pick up your sword, but it's not
                                  there... you just flail your hand about in the
                                  dark, searching

AV         12/13/01 12:08 AM Oh, before I forget to mention it... I am
                                  going to be working thursday through sunday in
                                  the evenings... I'll be out til 1 or 2 am on
                                  Thurs, 11 pm on Fri, and 9 pm on Sat and
                                  Sun... after those times, we can talk more if
                                  you are available

Kaori-Chan 12/13/01 12:08 AM ::Nod nods::

AV         12/13/01 12:09 AM I have to take a quick break, and I'll be
                                  back... we seem to be getting close to
                                  something here.. I want to continue with this,
                                  if you're up to it

Kaori-Chan 12/13/01 12:10 AM kk

AV         12/13/01 12:16 AM back ::smiles and hugs you::

Kaori-Chan 12/13/01 12:16 AM ::hugs back::

AV         12/13/01 12:17 AM how are you feeling tonight?

Kaori-Chan 12/13/01 12:17 AM sort of irritable.  I have a 2500 word article
                                  to work on before tomorrow.

AV         12/13/01 12:17 AM ack!

AV         12/13/01 12:17 AM am I distracting you?

Kaori-Chan 12/13/01 12:18 AM Not really working on it right now.

AV         12/13/01 12:18 AM oh... I guess that's why your replies have
                                  been brief... well, okay then... I'll get back
                                  to my inane rembling ::grins::

AV         12/13/01 12:20 AM wow, we've been talking for 2 hours already...
                                  time has a way of slipping by when chatting
                                  online...

Kaori-Chan 12/13/01 12:21 AM aye, it does...

AV         12/13/01 12:25 AM pretty soon I am gonna have to go to bed
                                  ::sigh:: okay... I am going to assume you
                                  don't have the time to try unlocking your
                                  potential in your present circumstances, and
                                  that it's up to me to sort out my situation
                                  and find my way to you first... if I
                                  understand things correctly, I don't need you
                                  to provide anything more than moral support...
                                  I should be able to accomplish this on my own

Kaori-Chan 12/13/01 12:27 AM ::nods:: Only you can find your own way.

AV         12/13/01 12:29 AM and even if I am there to help you, you're
                                  going to have to figure out how to tap your
                                  own potential... I might be able to do some
                                  things for you, like change your form if you
                                  want, but a lot of what I can do will depend
                                  on what you can tap into within yourself

Kaori-Chan 12/13/01 12:31 AM if you can learn, you can teach me.

AV         12/13/01 12:31 AM the thing most people don't realize is that
                                  they have working powers and they use it
                                  unconsciously to reinforce their grasp on the
                                  world... we're both using our powers, but for
                                  the most part in the ways we've been trained
                                  to 

AV         12/13/01 12:32 AM the actual power is necessary to our existence

AV         12/13/01 12:33 AM the trick is becoming more conscious of how
                                  the universe actually works... to do
                                  somethings, you have to work them into the
                                  fabric of things that are already established

Kaori-Chan 12/13/01 12:37 AM http://www.angelfire.com/anime2/superhighway/R
                                  view/fragile.html
                                  
                                  As an aside, I was always rather upset about
                                  this singular review.

AV         12/13/01 12:37 AM this is complicated by the fact that people
                                  have developed a very sophisticated map of
                                  existence which is dependant on remote
                                  observation... as a race, we have become
                                  dangerously detached from existence, denying
                                  the intimacy of our involvement in reality...

AV         12/13/01 12:38 AM I'm checking it out...

AV         12/13/01 12:42 AM wow... that's biting...

AV         12/13/01 12:44 AM has the story gotten any "more professional"
                                  reviews?

Kaori-Chan 12/13/01 12:44 AM That's the only review I've ever received...

AV         12/13/01 12:50 AM mmm... well, a negative review is not
                                  intolerable, but this... this is a poor
                                  "opinion" and falls worlds short of a "review"
                                  
                                  a person would be kicked from a writer's
                                  workshop for turning in a review like that.. I
                                  had some issues with the experimental writing
                                  style you used, and there were a number of
                                  character handling questions where I would
                                  have taken a different direction, but... I
                                  wouldn't even mention it if I did not have
                                  something constrictive to say... a big part of
                                  a review, particularly in online fan fiction,
                                  is to encourage improvement, not sling
                                  excrement about

Kaori-Chan 12/13/01 12:51 AM you've never visited the FFML, have you? =D

AV         12/13/01 12:51 AM nope... can't say I have

AV         12/13/01 12:51 AM I didn't mess with news groups much... I
                                  preferred to stick to browsing on the web

Kaori-Chan 12/13/01 12:51 AM there's lots of excrement flinging.  =)  Heck,
                                  I flung some when everyone and their monkey
                                  decided to rant at me about how great Genma's
                                  Daughter was.  I want that hour of my life
                                  back, dammit.  =)

Kaori-Chan 12/13/01 12:52 AM FFML not a news group.  Mailing list.

AV         12/13/01 12:52 AM mmm... email based? close enough to news
                                  groups for me... eww!

AV         12/13/01 12:59 AM mmm... got distracted... haven't looked at any
                                  ranma ff sites in a long time now...

Kaori-Chan 12/13/01 1:00 AM  we met because of my fiction...

                                  dinner and I have some movies I have to watch
                                  tonight if I want to see them before turning
                                  them in... I hate to brush you off for
                                  tonight, but I need the down time to unwind...
                                  today was really hectic at work and I'm really

Kaori-Chan 12/16/01 1:16 AM  not much.  =)  recently was visiting the
                                  Fanfiction IRC channel and a channel called
                                  Void on the same server, got banned from both
                                  for making snide, barbed comments about my
                                  fiction in relation to Red Death's review
                                  while RD was present in the room.
                                  
                                  However, you would be surprised at how many
                                  people seem interested in a story you talk
                                  down about... =D

AV         12/16/01 1:17 AM  were you there as yourself? as Kaoru-Sama?

Kaori-Chan 12/16/01 1:17 AM  Of course.  *nod nods*  ^>^

                                  there... I get the impression you got some
                                  kind of satisfaction out of it, and being
                                  banned to boot ::grins::

Kaori-Chan 12/16/01 1:23 AM  Critics are not everything.
                                  
                                  I enjoyed being banned because RD was
                                  responsible for it, and that means he has a
                                  weak mind that cannot deal with criticism...
                                  it means I have surpassed  him, and become a
                                  more balanced, cheery person in a way.  =)

AV         12/16/01 1:25 AM  You'll have to send me a copy of the log... I
                                  can't imagine how it went...

Kaori-Chan 12/16/01 1:26 AM  actually, it had nothing to do with a
                                  discussion with him.  I was talking down about
                                  my fiction using terms he used to describe it
                                  in his review, and telling people about my
                                  fanfic.
                                  
                                  Then I was asked to stop, and I said I
                                  wouldn't, but that they shouldn't feel guilty
                                  about banning me.  =)  I have no problem with
                                  the people in charge, just with him.

Kaori-Chan 12/16/01 2:01 AM  ^.^

AV         12/16/01 2:13 AM  it seems more like the beginning of something
                                  than a short story... as it is, it leaves a
                                  lot open to interpretation, but that's
                                  probably the point... I would recommend using
                                  the past tense form for this, because that
                                  would pull the reader into the story better...
                                  the use of present tense is common only in
                                  script writing and that tends to put the
                                  reader at a distance, or at least call extra
                                  attention to the written word... apart from
                                  that, there are a lot of points where I'd
                                  alter the phrasing and clean it up a bit...
                                  the flow and pacing are excellent and the mood
                                  supurb... it this is to remain a short story,
                                  I'd give a bit more information to establish
                                  the background and context, give a stronger
                                  impression of the people she's longing for...
                                  but if there is more to come, then what you
                                  have is sufficient...

Kaori-Chan 12/16/01 2:15 AM  Kk.  Did you feel that there was an
                                  inconsistency between the first half and the
                                  "DREAM" part of it, as in, did the second part
                                  seem more rushed and lacking in detail?

AV         12/16/01 2:19 AM  to be honest, once you get into the dream
                                  part, a lack of structural detail, such as
                                  time flow and cause and effect and relativity,
                                  is something of an advantage... the thing
                                  about dream states is that you get an
                                  incredible amount of irrelevant data, a sense
                                  of things out of place... it could use
                                  development in that sense, I didn't have the
                                  impression that she was dreaming, but that
                                  something real was happening that she was
                                  writing off as a dream... my attention was
                                  drawn more to a couple of points when you
                                  seemed to waver between past and present tense
                                  phrasing

Kaori-Chan 12/16/01 2:20 AM  Okay. *nod nods* I do have a tendency to shift
                                  between things like that.

                                  things that are out of place, she usually
                                  rationalizes them and imposes a context on
                                  them... keep that in mind if you use my
                                  suggestion to add that bit of warped reality
                                  to the dream part...

Kaori-Chan 12/16/01 2:22 AM  Okay.  ^>^

AV         12/16/01 2:24 AM  the mest alternative to an all out dream
                                  state, when a character confronts the unknown
                                  for real, it to let her act in a daze, the
                                  haze of being half awake, when something truly
                                  out of place is embraced by a mind that is
                                  only tentatively connected to reality... she
                                  can wake up to the reality she's gotten
                                  herself into well after the fact, and then she
                                  faces the impact... but if she can sleep walk
                                  her way over the threshold, it's an excellent
                                  way to get the reader to follow along with
                                  her...

AV         12/16/01 2:24 AM  best alternative... oops

Kaori-Chan 12/16/01 2:24 AM  mmm... interesting.  ^>^

AV         12/16/01 2:26 AM  also... if you want to keep it a short story,
                                  I'd set it up to unfold like so: she finds the
                                  key, goes home and falls asleep, wakes and
                                  confronts the portal in a daze and goes
                                  through... encounters a few things that are
                                  too good to be true, or something like that,
                                  and then, comes the the realization that
                                  somwhere in the mist of it all it became real,
                                  and she's actually there... and has to deal
                                  with the impact of what she's done, what she's
                                  gotten herself into, and what she's left
                                  undone behind her....

Kaori-Chan 12/16/01 2:27 AM  heh, yes, but you see one of the ways it can
                                  be read is that she committed suicide, or that
                                  her mind is contemplating change.

AV         12/16/01 2:29 AM  it's the salt in the dessert... she doesn't
                                  have to commit suicide, all she has to do is
                                  realize that her disappearance, so like her
                                  parents' disappearance, will lead people to
                                  believe she did... and she has no idea if she
                                  did die, or what... it's all a big unknown...
                                  and she'll want to find a way back, just to
                                  communicate her last requests, get her cat,
                                  things like that, and it might be too late for
                                  such thoughts...

AV         12/16/01 2:30 AM  one of the big questions, "if you die in your
                                  sleep, will you know you are dead?" can be
                                  addressed... 

Kaori-Chan 12/16/01 2:30 AM  Nonononono... you see, ending it there leaves
                                  the interpretations for the reader... adding
                                  the rest would make it obvious it's a longer
                                  story, and most readers would not get the idea
                                  that she might be dead.

AV         12/16/01 2:32 AM  hey, it's not like I am reading your mind... I
                                  am just taking a few swings... the thing to
                                  figure out is, what impression do you want to
                                  leave the reader with, and how do you pull it
                                  off... people will read things into anything,
                                  but you have to have something in mind to set
                                  the range...

Kaori-Chan 12/16/01 2:33 AM  See, if you had my teacher, you'd know why I
                                  wouldn't want to write a fantasy-like dream
                                  world.

AV         12/16/01 2:34 AM  all dream worlds are fantasy like... at the
                                  heart fantasy is just revealing our dreams...
                                  to make the fantasy acceptible, you have to
                                  weave it in the context of the character...
                                  make it their fantasy, not yours, that is
                                  revealed...

Kaori-Chan 12/16/01 2:34 AM  do you think FC could use a rework near the
                                  beginning?

AV         12/16/01 2:36 AM  FC could use a complete rewrite... you
                                  admitted to me that it was all pretty much a
                                  first draft... that's a big undertaking, but
                                  better that than a little bit of patch work...
                                  if you just fix up one part, then it will
                                  stand out from the rest...

Kaori-Chan 12/16/01 2:36 AM  Ack! ^.^;;;;

Kaori-Chan 12/16/01 2:36 AM  HUGE undertaking.

AV         12/16/01 2:38 AM  I know... but it's no bigger than what you'd
                                  face submitting a book to a publisher...
                                  they'd ask for a thousand changes and a total
                                  second draft... the trick is knowing how to
                                  parse the first draft to identify the flaws
                                  and work out solutions in simple, sweeping
                                  notes, before going into the second draft...
                                  you write the second drafe from scratch
                                  drawing on the first draft and the notes you
                                  make as a rough guide...

Kaori-Chan 12/16/01 2:39 AM  So you think I *SHOULD* Rewrite FC 1, 2:1, and
                                  2:2?

AV         12/16/01 2:39 AM  yes... at least consider that it needs to be
                                  done, when you can do it... the biggest thing
                                  is, you were experimenting with styles of
                                  writing throughout writing it, so it's a patch
                                  work quilt... you have to pick a style, a
                                  consistent voice to tell it from beginning to
                                  end

Kaori-Chan 12/16/01 2:41 AM  Not necessarily.  My experimentation has
                                  mostly been just for 3:1, the rest should've
                                  been consistently in the same feel.
                                  
                                  And 3:1 was experimented on on PURPOSE.  2:3
                                  comes across much clearer and more concise
                                  than the first three stories, which were
                                  written significantly before it.

AV         12/16/01 2:43 AM  actually, from the beginning, you were
                                  asserting an unconventional style of writing,
                                  at least that is the impression I have of
                                  it... mmm... to offer real input, I'd have to
                                  take the entire manuscript and vet it... break
                                  it down, identify the things that stand out,
                                  collect the threads and remap them... 

AV         12/16/01 2:44 AM  ... and somehow avoid getting on your nerves
                                  in the process ::smile::

AV         12/16/01 2:45 AM  is this something you've been giving a lot of
                                  thought to? 

AV         12/16/01 2:47 AM  ergh... I just noticed the time... we have to
                                  wrap this up soon...

Kaori-Chan 12/16/01 2:47 AM  Only recently.  ^>^
                                  
                                  Uhh, didn't you say you were going to give
                                  lengthy critiques of each chapter?

AV         12/16/01 2:49 AM  one of those time management glitches on my
                                  part... I seemed to have been under the
                                  impression I could make time for it... 
                                  sorry... I forgot when things became more
                                  personal between us... my attention shifted to
                                  you ::strikes her hands along your flanks, and
                                  leand her had against your chest::

AV         12/16/01 2:49 AM  strokes... 

Kaori-Chan 12/16/01 2:50 AM  You have struck me! =D
                                  
                                  heehee.
                                  
                                  Nah, I'd love something from the person I
                                  love.  =D Even if it's nasty and critical.

AV         12/16/01 2:51 AM  well... I'm not sure where I'd fit it in...
                                  how high a priority is doing a rewrite? (to be
                                  honest, I'd probably be able to do a revision
                                  easier than a critique... some things are
                                  easier to do than to explain)

Kaori-Chan 12/16/01 2:53 AM  Well, I am looking at Episode one right now,
                                  and fixing teeny details about the poem.  ^>^

AV         12/16/01 2:53 AM  oh, I can't actually to a rewrite, because you
                                  have this thing mapped out in your head, not
                                  in notes, I was only illustrating a point... I
                                  wouldn't dare try to take over FC! ::looking
                                  aghast!::

Kaori-Chan 12/16/01 2:54 AM  Mostly I would do a rewrite in order to
                                  clarify the story and make it more coherant as
                                  a work.

AV         12/16/01 2:57 AM  ::nod nods:: well... it's mostly up to you...
                                  I'm willing to see if I can put some time in
                                  on it, but my own writing time has been
                                  chopped down a lot... it might be just as well
                                  to pound out the rest of the story before
                                  doing a major rewrite... that way any changes
                                  that are needed to support the entire story
                                  can be figure out in context

Kaori-Chan 12/16/01 2:58 AM  pound out another 20 chapters? =)

AV         12/16/01 2:59 AM  if that's what it takes... if I don't know how
                                  it evolves and ends, I can't mess with the
                                  beginning without risking throwing off the aim
                                  of the story...

Kaori-Chan 12/16/01 3:00 AM  I just want reviews and suggestions on how to
                                  make it better, not someone to rewrite it FOR
                                  me.  ^>^

AV         12/16/01 3:00 AM  most of my aborted works are the victims of
                                  premature rewriting... I fix the beginning and
                                  suddenly it no longer leads to the intended
                                  conclusion...

Kaori-Chan 12/16/01 3:01 AM  Mm.  Fragile clay is incredibly complex, but
                                  clearing it up would benefit the story.  I am
                                  confident I can revise without destroying the
                                  overall meaning.  Mostly, grammar mistakes as
                                  well as word changes/ and sentance/paragraph
                                  revisions, rather than thinking of taking
                                  things in an entirely different direction.
                                  
                                  Not to mention, typically I end up adding
                                  important info when I revise a scene or some
                                  such.

AV         12/16/01 3:01 AM  I know... I was making a comment on my
                                  limitations as a writer... I like to jump in
                                  and do what needs to be done... I do all the
                                  analytical stuff under the surface, so, I'm
                                  not as effective at critiquing as I am at
                                  writing

AV         12/16/01 3:02 AM  mmm... just be careful... editing and revision
                                  in parts is not as effective as rewriting...
                                  editing can upset the flow of a work...

AV         12/16/01 3:05 AM  Mark, love? can we wrap this up for tonight,
                                  and get back to it tomorrow? It's 3 am and I
                                  have to do the dishes still...

Kaori-Chan 12/16/01 3:06 AM  yeah, you just needed to say so hon.  ^>^

AV         12/16/01 3:07 AM  mmm... ::flops against you:: well... let me
                                  say goodnight... I am fading fast... ::kisses
                                  you and hugs you tight::

Kaori-Chan 12/16/01 3:08 AM  ::Holds you, caressing your belly as he looks
                                  down at your eyes:: Sleep you well, my angelic
                                  one.

AV         12/16/01 3:09 AM  I will, love... with you in my heart...

AV         12/17/01 10:14 PM sorry about last night... I don't know when I
                                  can make it up to you... this week I'm on for
                                  five nights til closing... tonight and
                                  wednesday are my only nights off and tonight I
                                  have piles of laundry to wrestle with, and...
                                  to be honest, I am still a bit burned out... I
                                  don't know if I want to talk tonight, if I do
                                  come on it will be after midnight
                                  
                                  ::hugs::

Kaori-Chan 12/17/01 10:15 PM Uhhh, I am here right now.  ^>^

AV         12/17/01 10:16 PM I know, but I'm going to be busy for a couple
                                  of hours... I just came on to warn you and
                                  apologise for not showing up at all last
                                  night, while I get my laundry started...

Kaori-Chan 12/17/01 10:17 PM kk.  ::kisses::

AV         12/17/01 10:18 PM ::kisses back:: I'll check back again later to
                                  see if you're still up... if I miss you, I'll
                                  be here on Wednesday night...

Kaori-Chan 12/17/01 10:19 PM kk.  ^>^

AV         12/17/01 10:20 PM ::smiles and hugs you... then dashes off to
                                  take care of her chores::

AV         12/18/01 12:35 AM I'm not making my deadline... laundry is not
                                  drying like it's supposed to... fyi, the
                                  reason I am not sitting on the computer while
                                  my laundry is running is cuz it's cold in the
                                  garage, and my sheets are in the wash... I
                                  can't go to sleep til laundry is done and I'm
                                  curled up inside where it's warm watching old
                                  movies to keep awake...

AV         12/18/01 12:38 AM since I don't know how much longer this is
                                  gong to take, I am going to say goodnight now
                                  and let you go to bed... if you need... ::hugs
                                  and kisses:: I'll catch up with you on
                                  wednesday... take care, love

Kaori-Chan 12/18/01 12:46 AM ::Kisses:: I love you...

AV         12/26/01 4:07 PM  ::slips in and flops on the couch...::
                                  finally, a day off! ::smiles and kisses you
                                  hello::

AV         12/26/01 4:09 PM  I'm sorry I've been out of touch... I hope you
                                  had a decent xmas ::hugs::

Kaori-Chan 12/26/01 7:05 PM  Hai, merry belated capitalist day.  =D

AV         12/26/01 7:33 PM  ::smiles:: are you going to be up later?

Kaori-Chan 12/26/01 7:33 PM  probably not, haven't slept since yesterday at
                                  1pm.

AV         12/26/01 7:34 PM  mmm... that's not good... well, I'm off
                                  tomorrow too, so we can catch up then if
                                  you're available... I'm off to dinner here in
                                  a minute... 

Kaori-Chan 12/26/01 7:35 PM  mmm.  ::Kisses and hugs:: 

AV         12/26/01 7:36 PM  ::hugs you tight and warms your lips with
                                  hers...:: I'm just hoping I'm over this flu
                                  thing I got from work... I almost pulled a
                                  Hendrix the other night... ack! ewww!

Kaori-Chan 12/26/01 7:37 PM  ?  Hendrix?

AV         12/26/01 7:38 PM  it's not a pretty topic... actually, I was
                                  pretty scared... one of my greatest fears is
                                  throwing up in my sleep... I woke up and
                                  rolled to the side of the bed in the nick of
                                  time... ::shudders::

Kaori-Chan 12/26/01 7:39 PM  bleckth.  

AV         12/26/01 7:39 PM  yeah... but that's how Hendrix died... threw
                                  up in his sleep and drowned... of course he
                                  was too drugged to wake up, but ever since I
                                  heard the story it's creeped me out!

AV         12/26/01 7:41 PM  mmm... well, it's time to go... I'll check in
                                  when I get back to see if you're still up...
                                  if not, love you dearly, and I'll talk to you
                                  tomorrow... ::hugs::

Kaori-Chan 12/26/01 7:41 PM  ::Hug hugs and kisses gently on the nose:: =)

AV         12/26/01 7:41 PM  ::smiles and licks your chin:: g'night, love

Kaori-Chan 12/26/01 7:44 PM  goodnight, my darling one.

AV         12/27/01 11:19 PM ::looks at you and smiles::

AV         12/27/01 11:21 PM there are times when my life seems to be an
                                  endless chain of trying to catch up with
                                  things... there are always a million things to
                                  be done and the present never seems to be the
                                  best time to do any of them...
                                  
                                  it can be quite frustrating...

AV         12/27/01 11:23 PM I look at where I am, and what I am doing, and
                                  I wonder... when am I ever going to be done
                                  with this drivel and get on with my life? When
                                  am I ever going to be in the right place, at
                                  the right time?

AV         12/27/01 11:25 PM and I am always getting down on myself for
                                  allowing my hurt to become resentment,
                                  frustration, impatience and cause for
                                  complaint.. I hate myself for daring to
                                  complain, as if I ought to rise above this...
                                  but it always turns out that rising above
                                  things simply gives them license to go on as
                                  they are...

AV         12/27/01 11:28 PM I have all the answers in my head, and if I
                                  could live just in my head, I suppose things
                                  would be perfect... I've come to know myself
                                  well enough that I do not feel alone with only
                                  my own company... in a way, I sort of resent
                                  life for forcing me to face all the things
                                  outside my head that seem so imperfect... it's
                                  hard not to conclude that my unhappiness is
                                  the point of my life...

AV         12/27/01 11:31 PM ::shakes her head:: I've often held strongly
                                  to the idea that it's not what you've got, but
                                  what you do with it, that counts... it sort of
                                  falls apart when I look at things and see what
                                  I have in and of myself, and what I have in
                                  life... to do anything with one, I have to
                                  abandon the other... 

AV         12/27/01 11:36 PM it is my belief in myself that makes me a
                                  failure in life as David... because I am
                                  David... I am what makes him real, I am what
                                  makes him a beloved friend, brother and son...
                                  and apart from you, the world only knows the
                                  part of me that goes into being him... being
                                  him has made it impossible for anyone to see
                                  me for who I am...

AV         12/27/01 11:36 PM and it is not easy to be him...

AV         12/27/01 11:39 PM it is every bit as hard as playing the part of
                                  a character in a play... and the play never
                                  ends... no matter how I submerge myself in the
                                  role I play, the impulses, instincts,
                                  emotions, passions... the things that keep me
                                  alive... are those of the woman you love... a
                                  woman only you know...

AV         12/27/01 11:40 PM it sometimes scares me to just be myself with
                                  you, because it all comes so easily, so
                                  naturally, so effortlessly, it hardly seems
                                  real... the only comparison I have is the
                                  effort it takes to play my part...

AV         12/27/01 11:42 PM it is almost too much to believe that life
                                  could be something that can be faced without
                                  an exhausting effort to just go out and meet
                                  the trevails of life... that the obstacles I
                                  have to overcome just to be present in the
                                  world, before even the first hardships of life
                                  can be met, are not necessary

AV         12/27/01 11:46 PM ::sighs:: I don't know if you're there at the
                                  moment... please forgive me for going on like
                                  this... I suppose I just want to get this out
                                  of my system... maybe I just can't sit here
                                  silently waiting to see if you're there... I
                                  am sure you expected me to be on much
                                  earlier... 

AV         12/27/01 11:48 PM it's amazing how you can become used to pain,
                                  and yet feel its bite undiminished

AV         12/27/01 11:50 PM the things that always hurt me as a child hurt
                                  me just as much... they just don't surprise
                                  me, or alarm me... having failed to kill me, I
                                  suppose the pain makes less of an impression
                                  and simply is... a thing unrelenting and
                                  without any sympathy...

AV         12/27/01 11:53 PM I am sorry for you, for to know me is to know
                                  the taste of my pain... for you are
                                  sympathetic, loving, passionate... in a way,
                                  it is something of a relief to speak of it to
                                  you... though I hope it is not deminished at
                                  the cost of burdening you... as much as I can
                                  be, I am happy... you have chased away the
                                  spectre that whispered dire promises and
                                  temptations of death... you've given me a
                                  measure of strength to bear up under
                                  unbearable pain... 

AV         12/27/01 11:55 PM I need only think of you and I find I can
                                  stand it... I can look my demons in the eye
                                  and watch them dissolve into formless,
                                  impotent wraiths that can not feed on my
                                  misery and muse flee from me or starve...

AV         12/27/01 11:55 PM this gift of yours is with me always, your
                                  love... 

AV         12/27/01 11:59 PM I understand now how love can sustain a soul,
                                  even when the one you love, the one who loves
                                  you, is beyond your reach... I think that,
                                  even if you died, that I would feel your love
                                  supporting me, strengthening me... I hope I
                                  never have to find out, but at the same time,
                                  I feel certain of it...

AV         12/28/01 12:00 AM I feel certain because, even though there is
                                  so much I don't know about you, even though
                                  there is so much yet between us... I do not
                                  doubt your love... I do not doubt you...

AV         12/28/01 12:08 AM I know there are times when you say you love
                                  me, and I say nothing in return... I pray you
                                  hear what is in my heart, what is often to
                                  great to put into words... I love you openly
                                  and unreservedly... I love you with all my
                                  heart... my love for you is welded to your
                                  love for me, supporting me all the more...
                                  filling in the void others strive to fill with
                                  mere passion and heat... 

AV         12/28/01 12:08 AM though you and I have never touched, you have
                                  touched me more truly than anyone in my life

AV         12/28/01 12:09 AM the mystery of it is wonderous and profound...
                                  

AV         12/28/01 12:14 AM how can something transform everything and yet
                                  change nothing? I ask, because, looking at my
                                  life nothing I can see or touch or hold in my
                                  life has changed in anyway, but all of it has
                                  been transformed... my hunger for you, for
                                  your caress, is so strong it tortures me at
                                  times... but just knowing you love me, that
                                  pain seems to evaporate... I want you, I need
                                  you... but because I have your love, I am
                                  strangely satisfied... 

AV         12/28/01 12:14 AM the only thing that has really changed is
                                  me... and it makes all the difference in the
                                  world

AV         12/28/01 12:18 AM I once would have thought that my love for you
                                  would change nothing, for I truly loved
                                  everyone and everything... but I love no one
                                  as I love you... many times I've wondered what
                                  it is that makes you so special... there is
                                  nothing I can point to... you have your good
                                  points and bad, but I embrace them the same
                                  for they are part of you, and I love you in a
                                  way that transcends any measure

AV         12/28/01 12:21 AM my love for you even transcends all the flaws
                                  in my own existence... though my present
                                  condition and situation comes between us in so
                                  many ways, my love for you does not
                                  hesitate... I dare to love you even though I
                                  hardly dare to live as I am...

AV         12/28/01 12:22 AM I would have expected myself to hold back, to
                                  take no chance of being hurt by loving you...
                                  yet I don't 
                                  
                                  I never did

AV         12/28/01 12:25 AM ::looks you in the eye:: there have been times
                                  when I thought we were hurting each other...
                                  but I've come to realize that we've become so
                                  close that we can touch each other in places
                                  where we've been hurt or scarred by life, and
                                  where it truly hurts to be touched... but that
                                  pain was already there, it was not caused by
                                  you and I inflicting new pain on each other...
                                  

AV         12/28/01 12:29 AM we both have many sore spots we guard against
                                  casual contact with strangers, but as the pain
                                  is a part of us, and we are open to each
                                  other... we will often touch raw nerves in
                                  each other... there is no avoiding the pain in
                                  the pleasure of each other's embrace... 

AV         12/28/01 12:31 AM hopefully, love can heal those wounds...
                                  hopefully love can sooth the pain even the
                                  gentlest touch can arouse in our injured
                                  hearts... hopefully we can both heal enough to
                                  cast off these shells, the armor we have
                                  erected to protect ourselves from an
                                  indifferent world...

AV         12/28/01 12:33 AM maybe our healing will clear the fog of
                                  maddness that is part of this fever dream we
                                  call life...

AV         12/28/01 12:35 AM I know this, though... I am seeing you through
                                  eyes made clear

AV         12/28/01 12:39 AM I will say, up front, that I have heard others
                                  express their doubts about you... and even you
                                  have described your apparent shortcomings...
                                  for a while I wondered if I should have any
                                  expectations of you... could it be possible
                                  that I must look past my love to see your
                                  strengths and weaknesses and decide if you are
                                  worthy of me...? should I hold out for
                                  something better than you...?
                                  
                                  they seemed perfectly logical questions, but
                                  they made me uncomfortable... 

AV         12/28/01 12:41 AM in the end, I asked a different question. Am I
                                  worthy of you? My value, my worth is only in
                                  who I am, not an what I might happen to be...
                                  I could possess all the right things but only
                                  by being who I am could any of those things be
                                  real. 

AV         12/28/01 12:47 AM if you judged me solely by what I am, you
                                  could not love me as you do... to love me, you
                                  had to look past all the things that I
                                  possess... you had to look past even what I
                                  could say and ask yourself who could say such
                                  things, and thus saw who I am... 
                                  
                                  I did the same thing. When I came across your
                                  writing, I just knew. I recognized you by
                                  asking myself who could write Fragile Clay...
                                  I already knew I loved you. 

AV         12/28/01 12:51 AM All the things I have learned about you have
                                  stood up to the same test. Good or bad, there
                                  was no question that it was you I saw... you I
                                  loved. I fell into the trap of categorizing
                                  the details you embody by their linguistic or
                                  semantic definitions, and in that sense I
                                  could see many flaws... but a more honest,
                                  unbiased appraisal would be that in all the
                                  details I saw, what I saw most clearly was you

AV         12/28/01 12:53 AM many of the things that are considered flaws
                                  by cultural standards are in fact traits and
                                  characteristics which display your innate
                                  strengths... there is nothing so alien as a
                                  dragon to the human mind and human words and
                                  values do a dragon no justice

AV         12/28/01 12:57 AM when I look at you I see many things, but when
                                  I see you, I see beauty, charisma, wisdom,
                                  integrity, strength... you have an enormous
                                  ego, because deep down you know your own
                                  worth... most people cut you down because you
                                  don't measure up very well to their
                                  standards... it's their mistake for measuring
                                  you with the wrong ruler... 

AV         12/28/01 12:59 AM I think if people had ever bothered to value
                                  you for who and what you are--as an extension
                                  of who you are--you might not have become so
                                  antagonistic toward humanity... you're very
                                  open minded, but if you have a prejudice it is
                                  against laziness and stupidity that can exist
                                  in even the most intelligent people

AV         12/28/01 1:02 AM  honestly, you've been subject to people's
                                  prejudice almost without exception... enough
                                  so your own prejudice has become aroused...
                                  and that prejudice is the thing that people
                                  like Launce see, and attack, adding to the
                                  prejudice you face from such people... you
                                  find yourself judged by people who will see
                                  only what they choose to see, and who do not
                                  care enough to see the truth to bother looking
                                  for it...

AV         12/28/01 1:06 AM  people like Launce care only to know the
                                  facts, and use them to support their own
                                  prejudices... I might use subtler words to say
                                  the same thing, and say that people who depend
                                  on the facts are bound by the perspective that
                                  those facts can support, and the truth can
                                  very rarely be confined to the facts... it
                                  tends to encompass too much for facts to
                                  quantify or qualify

AV         12/28/01 1:10 AM  facts disguise the fiction that forms the
                                  foundations of our reality. Facts could blind
                                  me to the very reasons I love you. I see the
                                  facts, and strive to understand the context
                                  they fit into, but I also embrace the truth...
                                  that leap of intuition that leads to
                                  understanding that transcends mere
                                  comprehension... and my love for you will
                                  remain true.

AV         12/28/01 1:14 AM  if you ever ask yourself if you are worthy of
                                  me, remember that you did what no one else
                                  did. You did me the honor of seeing me for who
                                  I am, in light of and despite everything I
                                  appear to be. You did not add to the doubt I
                                  face whenever I confront another human being.
                                  You lifted the burden of doubt from our
                                  relationship. I don't know if that was wisdom,
                                  grace, or just love. I do know it is
                                  wonderful... 

AV         12/28/01 1:15 AM  you once said I gave you nothing, and that was
                                  more than anyone had ever given you... you
                                  gave me the benefit of the doubt, and your
                                  love... which is everything. You are worthy. 

AV         12/28/01 1:18 AM  if you look at yourself and see that you can
                                  be more... it will be because you are ready to
                                  be more for yourself, and I will love you, and
                                  share in the delight and wonder of your
                                  growth. If I seem to be asking for more from
                                  you, it is because I see so much more in you
                                  and want you to see it too... I want you to
                                  have the pleasure of realizing it... 

AV         12/28/01 1:20 AM  I have gone on for a couple of hours now... I
                                  hope you find these words and that they
                                  comfort you... I am sorry I missed you
                                  tonight...
