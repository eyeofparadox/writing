20070805 Ranma's Undoing

Kaoru: SO.....
Kaoru Shimitsu is online.
Kaoru: What would've happened if Kuno had had a brief moment of lucidity with Wishbringer and wished for the Pigtailed girl to LOVE him?
Alex: hides her hands behind her back, looking startled and faintly guilty
oh...
heh, heh, heh
Kaoru: What's that behind your back?
Peaks behind you
Alex: something drops to the floor, which she quickly kicks under the bed
nothing
Kaoru: Looks under the bed I dunno, I thought I saw you kick something
Alex: a high pitched voice cries out from the shadows as you lift the cover, "Bright light! Bright light!"
I really wasn't feeding it after midnight! I swear!
Kaoru: LAUGHS
right
So, anyways... what would've happened if Kuno had had a brief moment of lucidity with Wishbringer and wished for the Pigrailed girl to Love him?
or to marry him, for that matter? :D
Alex: eep
pigrailed girl?
laughs
well... I can't imagine Takahashi-san ever going there... oh, wait... there was that koi fishing rod thing...
Kaoru: Or better yet
Alex: so, it'd probably result in Ranma acting the same way, but toward Kuno, with some molesting going on, interfered with by all of Ranma's fiancees
Kaoru: what if Ranma did get the sword and wished for the curse to be gone... while still in girl form?!
BWAHAHAHAHAHA!
Alex: heh
what if they both got those wishes?
whoops!
that's a good idea for a fic right there!
Kaoru: both got those wishes?
Alex: double whammy
Kaoru: ooooh
oooh, right!
"WIshbringer! I wish for the Pig-tailed girl to fall in love with me!"
Alex: Kuno wishes for the pigtailed girl to love him, she wishes to be rid of the curse
yep
Kaoru: Kunou gets clobbered shortly after, the sword is stolen away, and Ranma wishes the curse away... oopsie, while still female
Alex: with one wish left that everyone fights over
Kaoru: oooh
I got it.
Everyone fights over the sword, Ranma eventually gets it back and wishes to unwish the stupid wish he made.... only to be told by the sword that it can't contramand it's own wishes...
so Ranma wishes everyone else was cured.
while making sure that they aren't going to get stuck like him?
Alex: nah...
Kaoru: appeals to the noble Ranma crowd, and I honestly think it'd be something he'd do if he knew he was stuck.
okay, so what do you think would happen? :D
Alex: the cursed guys would all want to get cured, and would intend to wish for cures to all the curses, except Mousse would be tempted to wish Shampoo loved him, she would be tempted to wish Ranma loved her, Akane would wish that none of this had happened and try to put things back to normal, and end up doing it totally by accident
leaving Kuno with the sword and three wishes again!
presumably, the cannon version is what results... I.E. Akane wishes that Kuno never thought of wishing for anyone to fall in love with him
that is, if you're going for a oneshot, that'd be the way to go
if you are going to start a whole epic using this, then you could have the last wish be something else
Kaoru: Oooh, or even better.... that last wish, Kuno was going to wish bigger boobs on Ranma. LAUGHS
Alex: OH! Kuno wishes to defeat Ranma in combat, causing the boy half to be returned, but seperate from the girl half, because the way the wish was phrased, she has to watch Kuno beat Ranma!
then, the boy Ranma has to come up with a way to free the girl Ranma from the love spell
heh

Kaoru: that too...
though I have to agree with some others. I find split ranma's not to be interesting stories in most cases.
Alex: I'll try not to take that too personally...
chuckles
Sent at 1:35 AM on Sunday
Alex: of course, the most likely reason Kuno never wished that in the first place is that he assumes that Akane and the Pigtailed girl already do love him... that they can't resist doing so
Kaoru: Well, splitting female from male tends to make it hardest on the female ranma... she serves as a reminder of the curse, and male ranma would be less interested in curing her than getting rid of her... Sure, he'd feel sorry for her, and try for some time to give her a solution, but I think in the end Ranma would settle down with Akane and etc.
Yeah, I know. :D
Alex: so, the story would have to have some way of prompting him to make that wish
as for the split in this case...
Kaoru: "Wishbringer! I wish that the immaculate love between my Pig-tailed girl and I shall be finally consummated in our union and subsequent marriage!'
Kaoru used to play kunou... very well
Alex: it is Kuno's notion of Ranma that the wish would summon, so it might be a warped "demon Saotome"
heh
Sent at 1:39 AM on Sunday
Alex: Maybe the wish would just be for the Pigtailed girl to "indulge his fantasies" or something, leaving her with a compulsion to do anything he tells her to, but leaving her more or less in her right mind the rest of the time
meh... getting too complicated
shrugs
stew on it for a while...
Kaoru: heh
Alex: the loophole could be that the 'love' is temporary or not romantic in nature
as in, "I wish for the Pigtailed girl to prove her love for me!"
which she sort of does by banishing "the evil sorcerer Saotome" in a way... heh
or, it could be that Ranma loses it when he realizes he's stuck permanently as a she, and through the course of events is actually helped by Kuno in a way that earns her respect and the love of friendship, since there has to be some kind of love for her to prove, which can be fulfilled by a simple act of affection or friendship
I can totally imagine what would happen if Kuno had to deal with a suicidal Pigtailed girl... how that could lead to him doing something genuinely helpful, however unappreciated it is at the time
it depends on how substantial a story you have in mind
Kaoru: true
Alex: I would make the third wish Mousse's, a kind of "I wish you would all just forget about Ranma Saotome!"
in a moment of selfishness, fed up with everyone worrying over the trouble Ranma is in--so his subplot would involve a lot of being ignored or taken for granted by people... which is about par for the course
is starting to like this idea more and more
of course, Mouse would have possession of the wishsword and not even realize it, having scooped it up with a barrage of hidden weapons during a fight, dragging it back into his secret stash with the rest of the weapons when he retrieves them
this way, the only way to set things back to normal would require finding another wish granting magic item or returning to Jusenkyo to get a Nanniichuan curse to go back, sort of, to the way things were
which of course would play into the "cure for everyone" opportunity...
ponders the options in silence for a moment
mmm...
Kaoru: heh.
You know, I think you really need to start a new story.
Alex: Kuno could end up offering to fund the trip to China to keep the Pigtailed girl from killing herself... and since everyone's forgotten who she really is, they jump on board just to get a free trip to China
laughs
do you get the feeling I want to do this story?
you came up with the original question, so you do have first dibs
Kaoru: I do not have dibs.
Alex: do you think I could do a good job with this?
Kaoru: maybe.
Alex: think it's worth writing?
Sent at 1:59 AM on Sunday
Kaoru: certainly.
:D Any good story is worth writing.
Alex: mmm... more evil ideas... heh
well, I'll keep thinking about it
I have been working on my book again, so I'm definately back in a writing mood these days
Kaoru: good.
Alex: mmmm... what if three people were struggling with the sword, and all shouted out a wish at the same time?
Sent at 2:06 AM on Sunday
Alex: mmm... tough one to pull off, but as long as the three wishes were compatible, they would be worked out together all at once
frowns and pushes the thoughts to the back of her mind
Kaoru: that could be interesting
Alex: I have to weed out all the worthless ideas before I'll know what to do
oooooooooo!
the trick is finding the right wording for the wishes, and making sure they're in character and impulsive, or simple enough to shout out quickly
Kaoru: yeah
Alex: Ranma's is easy, and so is the one I've worked out for Kuno...
Kaoru: and remember something... Book 15 is prior to Herb, Tarou, Ryuu Kumon, etc.
Alex: wow, that's a lot of story to revise...
assuming the story continues and those characters turn up at their usual places
Kaoru: it is also before the Mouko Takabisha and the Shishi Houkodan
but after the Moxibustion and Hiryuu Shoten-ha Training.
Alex: is it before the koi rod?
Kaoru: yep
Alex: hmmm...
Kaoru: heh, a lot of stuff happens in the second half of the series, ne? :D
Alex: here's a "compound wish" for Ranma and Kuno... Ranma wishes to be cured, but Kuno, also holding the sword to "grant her wish" mutters "I wish you were always like this" thinking of how nice she is being to him to get to let her make her wish...
it's granted as one wish
two wishes remain
but everyone assumes that two wishes have been used!
grins
oh, yeah... there's a lot of room to play
Kaoru: yep
although Kunou would likely say something to the effect of, "Oh, Pigtailed girl! I wish you would unveil your heart to me and show me your love always!"
Sent at 2:25 AM on Sunday
Alex: not a compatible wish
but it is in character for his more effusive moments
depending on how the moment is set up, it's possible to get the right effect and wording to come out naturally
Kaoru: moments?
Sniggers
Alex: Kuno is not always over the top
he has other, less manic, dramatic moments
heh
whenever he appears for more than a gag, he's pretty self contained... he's just totally detached from reality
Kaoru: "Oh, Pigtailed Girl. My Heart soars from your warmth and kindness, showered upon me though I yet be unworthy of your boundless love and beauty! How I wish that you were to me always as you are now!"
Alex: too wordy
Kaoru: yeah, but the wish comes fast at the end.
Alex: mmm
Kaoru: hehehe... Shampoo throws a rock to check if it's a bear, and says it sounds like a skull after it hits ranma's head.
Giggles
Alex: maybe it'd work if she's not really listening and makes a grab for the sword... but in the manga, doesn't the sword refuse to grant wishes for anyone but Kuno?
what?
what scene was that from?
Kaoru: Hot springs race
the book right after the wishing sword
and yes, the sword only grants Kunou's wishes.
the sword wielder.
Genma stold it and tried to use it and it was a no go.
Sent at 2:37 AM on Sunday
Alex: yeah, so Kuno has to make all the wishes... Ranma of course tried to get Kuno to wish for her cure, so basically he phrases it in a way that leaves her stuck as a girl... having her love him could be part of it, or a seperate wish, and Kuno is more than capable of wishing himself "rid of Saotome"
of course, if you just change the end of the race so that there's a tie, you could end up with the compound wish scenario too...
um... wait, two different story lines got crossed... Kuno got the sword because he was the one-millionth customer or something like that... I got the hot springs race confused with the wishbringer story for a moment!
giggles
Kaoru: heh
Sent at 2:48 AM on Sunday
Kaoru: poor Ryouga
wins the hot springs race, can't find jusenkyou... giggles
Sent at 2:51 AM on Sunday
Alex: so, instead of Kuno wishing for the Pigtailed girl to go out on a date with him, he wishes for her to prove her love to him, of course Ranma proposes dating him to get him to grant her wish, and before he can wish for something stupid, she promises to do anything he asks--or promises that he will be able to defeat Ranma Saotome in battle, if he simply grants her wish to be cured of her curse.
yeah, poor Ryouga...
mmmm... imagine if he had found Jusenkyo... dragging poor Ukyo there and getting her cursed!
laughs
Kaoru: ahhh. Pantyhose is in book 18. three books after the Wish sword.
Alex: mmm...
interesting
do you think Ranma'd still be around that long, if he got stuck as a girl?
Kaoru: I imagine that Ranma would try to stick it through with the Picolet Chardin challenge, because she'd view it as a way to take her mind off being stuck.
maybe bolster her confidence, as I'd imagine she'd win that challenge.
Alex: true
Sent at 4:03 AM on Sunday
Alex: this all would be before Nodoka learned about Ranma's curse, so "Ranko" would have someone to turn to if things were not going well with the engagement... there would probably be some scheme for restoring Ranma's manhood... if not, the only way to fulfill the engagement would be for Ranma to marry Soun (as Soun treatened when the curse gets locked during the Herb arc) but Ranma would not stick around if it was suggested....
a lot changes if Ranma gets stuck as a girl...
Kaoru: Yeah... but Ranma is pretty tenacious.
Alex: true, but Ranma had to literally knocked out (by Akane) to keep him from going back to China for a cure in the first place... a good reason has to be given for her not to go straight to Jusenkyo to regain her manhood
now, it's possible that she does get there, say by winning the hot springs race, but for some reason or other is not able to get cursed again (the wish might prevent it, for example)... that would force her to deal with being stuck, and the families might hold off on things hoping to find some other way of fixing things...
there are plenty of things to explore, so I'm sure there's a good alternate story to tell
