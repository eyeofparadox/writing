Kaori-Chan: aaah, when you say it in that manner, it changes entirely what you mean though.

When saying you value significance and such.
AV: when words are almost certain to fail you, say more by speaking less
AV: some things are dangerous only because you fail to recognize their nature, and account for it in you actions regarding it
Kaori-Chan: Regardless, perhaps I am wrong.
AV: I am not saying you are, just pointing out that the possability of danger is not a promise of danger... but I should add, in life there are some dangers you cannot avoid... 
AV: I have to admit, I am rather cautious in dealing with Launce... he is the first to admit that he doesn't care to look at the big picture, and that it sort of boggles his mind that there would be any need for anyone in the matrix to see the big picture... it strikes him as an abberation
AV: it's hard for him to see that there is a legitimate purpose for someone like me to be here to do what I have always known I am here to do... thus, such a conviction is either alarming or absurd to consider... he admits that I do not register as a threat... and that reinforces his belief that I am being foolishly ambitious and self deluded
AV: and I understand his reasoning... I often wonder if the world is really ready for someone like me to come fully online... then again, I've seen lots of reasons why a bigger gun might need to be brought to bear
AV: I don't really try to convince him that I am right, or that my existence is justified... it doesn't hurt me to listen to his take on things... especially since my path has brought me to this quite exclusively... there is guidance in life, there is a natural flow... if you fight it, bad things happen... if you heed it, you grow and learn...
Kaori-Chan: ?????
AV: I am not here, living in his house, listening to his concerns and advice by accident
AV: think of it this way, in the past few years, the only way I could really have strayed off the path would have been to jump off the side of the cliff it's climbing
AV: to have my conviction, my faith in myself, tested every step of the way does not strike me as out of place... not with the path I am walking
AV: to come across one of the most formidible people alive in the world today, at this juncture, does not surprise me either...
AV: you want to know what the question's I've faced really boil down to?
Kaori-Chan: Alex? Are you there?
AV: yes... 
AV: have you gotten any of what I've been saying?
