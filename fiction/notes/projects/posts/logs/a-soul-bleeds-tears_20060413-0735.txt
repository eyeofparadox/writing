[20:25] AV: mmrowww!
[20:25] * AV was not... herself last night...
[20:27] AV: I...
[20:27] * AV sighs
[20:27] AV: 'm sorry...
[20:29] * AV will hang out to see if you come back...
[20:34] AV: I got home from work yesterday and started cleaning and organizing my hard drive to kill time... ended up getting so caught up in what I was doing I lost track of time...
[20:37] AV: I didn't expect you to be on until about now, tonight... I guess I should have opened up trillian earlier, but I put on a movie for dinner so I didn't
[20:37] * AV hugs herself
[20:37] AV: I'm so stupid...
[20:38] AV: no... it's not "bad me" again...
[20:38] AV: I'm just... I'm not good at taking care of myself... I try so hard not to think about myself that I don't even think about you
[20:40] AV: because I'm trying not to think like myself...
[20:40] AV: that's what's so stupid
[20:40] AV: ...
[20:41] AV: I'm upset because the "price" of having my Dad help fix my car is that I have to "find a better job"
[20:42] AV: not a bad idea, but change without improvement is just meaningless change... it just makes it harder
[20:42] * AV growls under her breath
[20:43] AV: I genuinely care about people... enough that I feel incredible pressure to do the things they expect of me...
[20:43] AV: and then I rebel, because I can never do what I expect of myself!
[20:43] * AV laughs bitterly
[20:44] AV: I don't know how I can be full of so much anger and think of myself as a good person...
[20:45] AV: maybe... it doesn't matter if I'm a good person... the one constant in my life is that things work to bring out the worst in me, and sadly I allow it
[20:46] AV: it still infuriates me that I learned how to pose as a guy so well, that I was able to convince myself so often that I really was a guy... that I can turn myself off and be someone else
[20:47] AV: it infuriates me, because of what I have to do... and because of what I DO when I do...
[20:48] AV: I forget what really matters... I neglect myself... I neglect you...
[20:49] * AV could just scream... if only she'd let herself...
[20:49] AV: ...
[20:49] * AV takes a deep breath and collects herself
[20:49] AV: I know you don't like to hear stuff like this...
[20:50] AV: you're probably as tired of my "excuses" as everyone else...
[20:52] * AV spent too much of her life trying to explain herself...
[20:52] AV: but, really, I couldn't just tell anyone the truth
[20:54] AV: it hurts... so much... that I just... can't... think... I can't feel anything else... 
[20:54] AV: no matter how much I care... no matter how important eveything else is... 
[20:56] AV: it takes everything I've got to just keep breathing...
[20:56] * AV burys her head in her arms
[20:57] AV: and the worst part is... 
[20:58] AV: I'm so good at hiding the fact that this is happening to me
[20:58] AV: I just smile and drag myself through life as if it's not just making everything worse... as if it were no trouble at all...
[20:59] AV: and I have the gall to get angry and upset when people see that and expect more from me?
[20:59] * AV laughs
[21:00] AV: ...
[21:01] AV: I hate people who think I am obsessed with obtaining something I don't have... I'm sick and tired of trying to explain this hole that has been ripped out of me, into which I am bleeding to death, that I struggle to survive in the hope of finding some way of mending...
[21:02] * AV cries silently
[21:02] AV: I'm tired of breaking down...
[21:03] AV: I know you know all of this...
[21:03] AV: I know you've heard it all before... that you understand...
[21:04] AV: it's just... when I fall apart... I have to say it all again so I can understand what's happening to me and why...
[21:07] AV: damn...
[21:08] * AV rubs her face and pushes her hair back
[21:10] AV: I spent too much time waiting to die... because I don't doubt the world's promise to kill me if it can... 
[21:11] AV: I say that because I'm afraid that's what I'm really doing...
[21:13] AV: I keep living because I truly believe I will assert myself... but every day that passes without that vital part of myself awakening and doing what needs to be done is a day of torture I've allowed myself to suffer...
[21:14] AV: that's what undermines my self confidence
[21:15] AV: I know the capacity lies within myself to heal myself and assert my true form, and I don't know why I cannot use that capacity... why I do not do what I need to do...
[21:16] AV: ...
[21:16] AV: that's what makes it so easy to "ignore" you... because simply being as I am shows utter indifference to your needs... 
[21:17] AV: I am guilty of not being true to you...
[21:17] AV: by simply being as I am
[21:18] AV: and I wonder if there's some part of me that won't forgive that... that I can't be true to myself if I am not true to you...
[21:20] AV: and being the way I am is how I punish myself for that failing...
[21:20] * AV falls silent
