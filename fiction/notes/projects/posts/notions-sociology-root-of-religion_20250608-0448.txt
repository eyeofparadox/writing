At the heart of every religion lies a common miracle, the human mind. An apprehension of that miracle, the containment of the world and the self within the mind, certainly plays a key part in the most basic "religious" experience or epiphany. In many respects, even if it is not clearly recognized or presented as such, religion struggles to account for the containment of the mind in the body and the world. The result is the belief in a special context for existence, the spirit. This is on one hand a very important thing, because it demands recognition of the existence of the mind itself, which is essential to the experience of life--if not neccessarily in order for life to exist--but which can not be accounted for as part of the physical universe. It also proposes that the mind could be more than the light from a light-bulb, a mere epiphenomenon of the brain; it gives us the concept of the soul.

The existence of the soul is something that can only be contemplated from the position of an individual mind. That is, the mind considers its own existence and the prospect of that existence terminating at death or continuing in another context after death. This is a question that can not be answered experimentally. One cannot know if there is a continuity of consciousness and individuality after death unless one dies and experiences it. Even if someone dies and is revived, or miraculously resurrected, it is reasonable to question whether one has actually died or simply come very close to death. How often have people been given up for dead only to surprise everyone by showing up later alive and well? How often has someone been declared dead only to respond to some last desperate attempt to revive them? It is a hallmark of dramatic story-telling that we are exposed to repeatedly.

There are things that happen in our lives that are inexplicable and religion emerges as a way to explain them. In time, with the growth of human understanding and knowledge, a secular explanation for things that happen can emerge to challenge the teachings of a faith. Religion is bounded by these two facts, or rather between these two circumstances, ignorance and knowledge. People have this amazing capacity to be blissfully ignorant and critically knowledgable of the world at the same time. At the time of its creation, every religion in history has embodied this human characteristic by addressing the unknown from the perspective of the known. The mystical aspect, the apprehension of the soul and deeper truth, and the practical aspect, the teachings of morality and purpose, are concentrated into a system designed to unite a community. 

I think this is a good place to point out something about "religious atrocities." The history of religion is often bleak and discouraging, but that is often due more to the politics and exploitation of religion that occurs than religion itself. The problem is that religion, however it is inspired, is a human creation. As a result, all of humanity exists in one common physical reality, but humanity itself is divided amongst many different spiritual realities. Thus, religion serves as a basis for human conflict. Since it is the spiritual reality that contains an individuals hopes of salvation, immortality and destiny, many people are willing to defend their faith with their very lives. Originally, religion helped to create communities by helping people learn how to coexist. As those communities grew, political, social and economic systems evolved, all with their own special concerns and interests. Because of the importance of religion to people, because it is invested with faith, religion is often manipulated for political, social and economic gain. Most of the time, it is human ambition that leads to religious oppression or war. As you come across accounts of bad things done in the name of religion, take a closer look. There are plenty of examples where human ambitions are presented as "the will of God."


That is why it is important to address religion in terms of its origins, not its outcome. When a witch is burned at the stake, or an adulteror stoned to death, or when the unbeliever is killed on sight, that is simply an end to which religion has been put. Religion is a tool, and like many tools, it can be used as a weapon, and that is a hard thing to explain or understand from the end effect. It is a lot easier to understand when you look at its root, what it actually is, and then, maybe, you can see how it became possible for more people to be killed in God's name than for any other reason. 


"An eye for an eye..." is a good example of scripture that is dangerous if interpreted literally. It is certainly the case that crimes are rarely prevented by threats of punishment, even in the brutal "old testament" style. "Turn the other cheek..." is a much more human and practical teaching. Revenge is a deadly cycle, and it can only be broken if someone is willing to forgive the insult or injury. Either way, it is up to the individual to determine how a teaching should be interpreted and applied to his or her life. However, many people do not choose to contemplate the teachings or interpret them for themselves; instead, many people simply subscribe to someone else's interpretation of the scripture, often taking it literally in the form it is presented to them. This happens because some people turn to religion as a way to abdicate responsability, while in truth, religion requires people to take responsability for their own lives and actions. Islam is a difficult religion to study because the only legitimate form of the scripture is in arabic. Islam requires the Koran be read and interpreted in arabic. Islam also uses many other scriptures to support and give context to the Koran. There are many parts that can not be understood without an understanding of the related text. When scholars, who so know arabic and have studied the Koran and related scripture, say that strict interpretation of the Koran compells Muslims to conquer the world and convert everyone to Islam, I would take that as an informed opinion and present it as such, but it is not a substitute for learning arabic, studing Islam and interpreting it for myself. The question, and the key to interpreting all scripture, is, should any scripture written by a human being (however inspired) be taken literally as the word and commandment of God? More importantly, if God commands something, are we compelled to obey (thus surrendering our own free will) or do we follow our own conscience (demonstrating free will)?

Religion is a philosophical mine field. It is not a place to tread lightly or with overconfidence. 


It is in our nature to form ideas about the world based upon our observations and experiences, and we all do it. In the world, and in our selves, we find things that are difficult to comprehend or explain. Sometimes these mysteries are profound and wonderful, and sometimes these mysteries are profane and terrifying. For any given concept or idea there is an understanding or interpretation that strives to explain or define these mysteries and the value and importance of those definitions and explanations comes from the usefulness of the perspective they create. The beliefs and traditions of indigenous people were developed by people who lived in and saw themselves as part of the natural world. Indigenous were very conscious of their dependence upon the land, plants, animals and elements in order to survive. In order to survive, they had to be very attentive to the winds and tides, the sun and rain, the moon and the seasons, because these things defined the conditions for prosperity. In exchange for taking what they needed from the world, indigenous people endowed the world with human attributes, intelligence, emotion, character, pride and wisdom, and recognized those traits in animals. This sense of common ground encouraged indigenous people to extend their concept of community to include the world around them and made their relationships with the world important.

What spiritual purpose do you think they serve for indigenous peoples?

By seeing and recognizing the connections between all things in the universe, indigenous people established themselves as part of the natural order, rather than existing under it or imposing themselves as unqualified masters. They could be honest and sincere in the manner they chose to live, and that allowed them to develop true common sense. More importantly, it allowed them to extend their sense of the sacred and spiritual beyond their personal selves. The abstract aspects of consciousness, thought, understanding, awareness, purpose, identity--the intangible aspects of people that the apprehension of the spirit is based upon--could be extended to the universe in all of its diversity and revealed that all things in creation are important. It gave all things a soul, and completed the circle of life by making birth and death doorways to another realm of existence that was home to those not yet born and those passed away. Most important, it made it possible for human beings to relate to all parts of existence as human beings. It made being human (a good human) important; good character, responsability, respectability and self-sacrifice became the coin of the universe.  


One of the consequences of institutionalizing religion is the creation of authority. The more important the doctrine of a religion becomes, the more dangerous knowledge that challenges that doctrine becomes. Since doctrine begins as a sincere attempt to explain the world, the fact that the explanation was needed proves that a thing was not well understood. Knowledge about a thing will grow as more time passes and more people study and think about that thing, and eventually a clearer understanding will emerge, and if it challenges or contradicts the established doctrine it undermines the authority of that doctrine, throwing into question other teachings about other things. Once a religion becomes a means to power, it ceases to be a means of enlightenment and becomes a means of enslavement. The same thing can happen to a form of government, because government is also often based upon the institutionalization of ideas or ideals. The thing that creates a society can very easily become the means to command and control that society. The structure provides for the creation of authority, and those who claim that authority gain privelege and to defend that privelege they defend and abuse their authority. The religion, or in the case of a government's founding ideals, remains true in those who practice it, but it is corrupted by those who try to control it.


First, in response to the issue of true believers, only the individual can know if his or her belief is true, but in the case where a person acts upon what they think God commands, it is more probable that they are true in their belief, and thus as much a Christian or Muslim or Samaritan as a person can be. That does not mean they cannot misunderstand God's commandment. When people make mistakes in thinking it is usually because they are inclined to think in a particular way and that might make them bad people, but again that does not make them bad Christians/Muslims/etc. There are many things that can make people's thinking unclear, like doubt, fear, anger, hatred. In my own heart, when I see a person do something evil to another person, I am hurt, because I realize that in order for them to do this, they must have had something evil done to them and done evil to themselves. I grieve, because I can see that they have failed themselves. I do not condemn them, I could hardly damn them more than they have damned themselves. I am wary of them, because no one can remove evil from his (her) heart without first confronting it and finding the strength to forgive themselves for it. Only then can they forgive the evil done to them, and heal.

As for the comparison of Christians and Muslims... I feel I am misunderstood. In both religions there is an emphasis on "spreading" the religion. In both religions there is an emphasis on being the "true" faith and the only way to God or salvation. This is neither a good thing nor a bad thing. It is generally just a thing. As I posted in one of my previous classes, even if there is a better answer, a better way to live, or an absolute truth, no one has the right to force it on anyone. It is good to make it available for people so they may consider it and decide for themselves if they will accept it, and I admire those who have shared their spiritual beliefs in this way. But there are so many instances in history when that choice was not respected. Good things can be used to do evil. Good people can be used to do evil. Is it not said that the path to Hell is paved with good intentions? Good intentions are not enough. Trust is not enough. Faith is not enough. To repeat another earlier post, an open mind must be guarded by open eyes. There is so much more to see, to understand, and no one really wants to. But, even if you choose not to look, it is hard to avoid seeing it. The world is in bad shape. Not because no one is doing the right thing. It is because there are not enough people doing the right thing. It is because, in order for the world to be in good shape, we all have to be doing the right thing. Anyone not living up to that is upsetting the balance. A few, influential, powerful people are capable of completely destroying the balance, and misusing religion is one of the ways they do it.


Life is complex. It is complex in it's complexity. It often seems that life is an endless series of frustrating random events, and this is especially true when people do not have time to stop and think about the world they live in. Over time, patterns and influences can be picked out, and given enough time and contemplation our observation of the world can become so sophisticated that we can figure out that very little in life is truly random. It is just complex. Science is, literally, knowledge. Modern knowledge, or science, is respected because it has become a tradition to test ideas before accepting them as facts, and to keep testing ideas even after they have become accepted as laws. Where science is a body of knowledge, religion is, for the most part, a body of wisdom, and for a long time people kept knowledge and wisdom together. Now, we have great knowledge, but we have seemingly lost our minds, eschewing wisdom to the point where common sense isn't very common any more. While it is acceptable in our modern "scientific" thinking to turn to philosophy for wisdom, people do not practice philosophy, certainly not in the intimate, personal, responsible way that religion is practiced. Religion is often based upon great philosophy, but few people embrace it as philosophy. Today, the world seems to be starving for real, spiritual truth and meaning, the kind that allows them to go about their daily lives knowing that their tiny observance of passed on wisdom is helping to preserve the world for themselves and their children.

In this day and age, it has become evident that Man is a great and terrible force and when what is best in men is not expressed in every man, woman and child, Man is capable of blindly destroying the world.


This brought to mind the title of a movie called "Koyaanisquatsi" which was a Hopi word for a "world out of balance" and it showed, through shocking imagery, the damage that industrial, capitalistic civilization has done to the world and to the people in it. The movie was made in the '70s or '80s and might be hard to get, and I may have spelled it wrong, but as Shemicka says, when the cycles of life lose their balance, life is doomed.

An intersting thought that just hit me is that Christianity, Judiasm and Islam all view the end of the world as inevitable, and one or two of the things I read on Native American mythology also speaks of a time when the world will be remade without imperfection, but on the whole, the teachings and character of the indigenous religions are that we are not supposed to bring about the end of the world. We are supposed to tend to and preserve the world indefinately, and only through our foolishness and greed are we doomed to destroy ourselves. Considering that we cannot know, we can only hope or believe, that there is a better world after this one, it ought to be plain that greed is the greatest of human follies and we should be brave enough to shout out to the world that only fools would covet wealth above all, and recognize that those who have wealth must be fools and remove them from positions that allow them to spoil the world out of greed. People who are not fools need to look at where wealth comes from, how it is created and what it truly costs and how it can be and is abused. 

It seems strange for us to think of ourselves as civilized people looking back on a primitive culture, when if anything, it seems that the indigenous cultures had a much greater sense of responsability for their actions and valued their environment far more deeply and sincerely than our culture is capable of. One of the reasons Native Americans suffered so much from contact with Europeans was because they did not have a concept of land ownership or wealth. If anything, they considered themselves owned by the land, owing their very existence to the earth, the plants and animals, the water, the sky. They did have a concept of trade and valuable possessions, but things had value by virtue of being good tools or helping a community to survive. They knew, far better than we, the true value of the world they lived in and with every action they reinvested in that world by showing respect and being responsable. That is something most of us would be incapable of without having all the comforts and indulgences of our "civilized" world removed. We struggle in our lives, and complain about our hardships, but how many of us had had to survive entirely by our wits relying only upon what could be found freely in our environment? How many of us could?


How does modern monotheistic religion teach us to show respect and responsability for the water we drink and bathe in, the air we breathe, the earth that provides everything we have or the things we create them from? How often does modern religion call our attention to the depletion of our natural resources, the overfarming of our fields, the overfishing of our waters, the effects of over-popluation in general? Have modern religions become weaker guiding influences because of science and industry or capitalism? Why is it so hard for us to understand what a precarious position we are in, and what will it take to make us all see the truth and act upon it? And, if we are aware of our peril, what is it that makes us stand helpless and watch as it continues to go on? Is it possible that there simply is no spiritual tradition that can show us how to survive in the world we have created?

If so, can the spiritual traditions of a world we have all but destroyed help us restore that world and the sanity of our species?
