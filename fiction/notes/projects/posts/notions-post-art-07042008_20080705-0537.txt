Debris Field

It's been hard to find time to work on art this year, so I often work on bits and pieces as time permits. This picture was started about a year ago. Everything in it, save for the clouds, was generated from scratch in Photoshop; the clouds were based on a fragment of clouds from a satellite composite (I think I found it on the NASA site originally). I am still trying to find a way to create realistic planetary clouds from scratch, but even with a base it takes a bit of work to get clouds that look this nice.

As always, each illustration presents new challenges. In this case, I was trying to improve on past attempts at space debris. I know it's not perfect, but the technique I used for this has its limits. If I want to do better, I will have to develop a new approach, I think.

A Modest Nebula

This piece was begun about a month or two ago, prompted by one of many experiments with creating planetary surfaces from scratch. The nebula is a reworking of the layers used in "A Distant Nova" from about three years ago. The insight I gained from developing this nebula prompted me to try something more complicated, which I will be posting shortly. 

A Colorful Nebula

The planet and moon are new versions of work I've done before that I did not have any use for until I decided to experiment further with a technique I developed for creating a nebula. The elements in this picture are all developed from scratch in Photoshop--even the planetary cloudscape. The technique I developed for these clouds is derived at the same time as the surface texture, and has been very difficult to replicate. If time permits, I will try to rediscover how I did it the first time!
