gravity

An Observable Phenomenon
Action-at-a-distance
Kepler Motion
Force, Mass, Energy
Newton's Laws of Motion (i.e. the ideas of force, acceleration, momentum, and mass) 
Motion - transformation, matter, energy, space, time; action, reaction, interaction - push, pull or attraction, repulsion
Conservation of Energy
Universal Law of Gravity, inverse square relationship of mass and distance (also center of mass, center of gravity)
Space, Time
rate of change, frame of reference : the speed of light, the laws of physics
Einstein's General Theory of Reletivity - distribution, four dimensiona space time, warping
Geometrodynamics, Non-Euclidean Geometry
Mass interaction with space-time, mass-energy relationship - medium of energy, media of matter
van der Waals forces
Electromagnetic forces
Scale, Planck Scale or Length
Resolution
Optics

action-at-a-distance~force : dimension~non-local phenomenon

properties of energy

structure - objective : substance - subjective

distributed process, resolution, frame of reference constant and conservation of energy conformation
integral forces, integrity

energy itself can not be created nor destroyed, it can be converted or invested into structure, thus redistributed, producing integral forces : mass is not a specific property in itself, but rather a consequence of creating structure, or rather structuring energy itself. 

look at the relationship between energy and information

look at the relationship between potential and actual

look at the relationship between persistence and resistence, consider resonnance

look at the property of change and process, consider the property of relation and continuity

look at the relationship between acceleration, momentum, gravity and intertia, consider the nature of forces, flow
