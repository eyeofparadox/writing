mass

is associated with gravity

is not a constant?
...implicit in the assertion that mass increases as an object approaches the speed of light
...an implication here is that an objective relationship between mass and motion might be derived
...is a property of matter, but not matter itself 

matter

is a structure of bound forces 
.:.electric, magnetic, gravitic, strong-nuclear, weak-nuclear 

change is the only constant

energy

is associated with mass ~ E=mcc
is associated with force ~ f=ma

time

dynamic

constant
