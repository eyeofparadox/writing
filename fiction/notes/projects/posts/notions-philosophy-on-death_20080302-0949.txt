to me death is insanity. It is a condition which makes no sense to exist in. It is the only reward for living a meaningless existence. My way forces me to accept life, while this other way forces people to accept death.

I cannot accept the unknown of death. It is a moment which one sort of has to create for oneself. It is a moment ripe with possibilities, and most ultimately demanding of one's self. When you die, anything you can imagine can happen. 

To embrace nothing is to isolate awareness--in effect, forcing awareness to confront itself. To embody nothing--well, that is tantamount to ultimate undoing. To not be. That is the end of awareness. It is the atheist's death. That is what the psychology of reducing all we are to a lump of clay has given us. It took millions of years to breathe life into that clay, and scientists are on the verge of blowing it right out. If you think you can accept that--like a sane, mature, modern individual--just try to be aware of nothing. You cannot do it. You would kill yourself trying. 

If I were to accept that my existence is subject to the harshness of reality, death becomes the ultimate betrayal and the final blow against my self.
