I can almost picture my dream come true. It takes a miracle, and it might even mean the world we know is not the only world we have known. A world remembered by a man who remembers me. I mean, like myself, that past might not actually exist. But, if a ghost of a girl like me can dream, even write those dreams down, than maybe there was a place, there was a time, when the things that fill our fantasies were real. Maybe, like me, they can still come true. Not that I have to tell you, I have something of a vested interest that being the case. For the rest of you, well, I can at least ask for the suspension of disbelief. 
	I know that won't be easy. In fact, I am certain I am going to stretch that almost beyond endurance. It will even break at one point, maybe more. I know it did. The funny thing is, time keeps going on. If you just keep going on, even dreams torn asunder can mend. It's okay. The other side of it is, if you stay with me, if you hear me out--if by some wild, wonderful chance, you actually come to believe me, to believe in me--the implications might even scare you. That's okay too. At times, the implications terrify me. 
	You get used to it. 

A good scare is like good sex. It is gripping and all consuming for an eternal moment, but once it has washed through you and you catch your breath, it evaporates. Like smoke, it unravels, curling in upon itself and expanding into nothing. Before you know it, only the memory remains.
