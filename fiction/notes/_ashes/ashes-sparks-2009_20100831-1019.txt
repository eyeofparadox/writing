the childhood trauma

20081117 - <linked inspirations> previous incarnations of this project include the childhood trauma that left the girl haunted by a demon within. the origin of the demon has been tied to the origin of the rift and the splintering of reality. the basic questions that need to be answered, in order to incorporate this thread successfully concern the origin of the demon, the reason for its involvement in the attack on her family, and the reason for the attack itself. 

the reason for the attack, and the demon's involvement, have evolved from story ideas adopted for use in the abyss; the demons were aliens responsible for attempting to turn humans into weapons, and when the humans rebelled and fled, the demons hunted them down and tried to wipe them out. originally, the demon trapped in morgan's mind had no special significance. a later revised approach features an individual -- or an entity hiding within an individual -- in the household who is the target of an assassination attempt, and the rest of the household is simply collateral damage. 

some of the recent variations set on aeirn have been tied to the northern purge and a retaliatory plot involving the conquest of a neighboring kingdom. an alternative might feature an attack upon a group her family was involved with, that was engaged in something perceived as a threat to the demon or demons that attack. an academy devoted to the study and training of psychic ability, probing the nature and origins of the rift, would provoke gods, angels and demons alike. an attack by demons would be most likely; the students and members of the academy were formidable opponants. 

the academy is part of an order that is aware of the splintering of reality and is the bridge between them. the girl is a survivor of the destruction of a branch of the academy and, in some approaches, the loss of the splinter of reality she belonged to. 

..............................................................................................................................
the splintered realms premise was explored as a way of introducing the male and female incarnations of the main character, using a rift to bring them into the same realm at the time of the massacre. 

..............................................................................................................................
the origin of complementary incarnations of a resurrected soul of creation could be completely revisited. 

20081100 - <variant - > the idea of the soul of creation, the first soul claimed and eclipsed by a demon, as the focus lends itself to all versions of an attempt to conceive an incarnation of the soul of creation. the demon's angelic origin and fall, and the conception and birth of the original incarnation of the focus in another realm, can all be drawn from existing impulses. the opening act would be set in the avon realm. the second act would be the age of gods on aeirn, climaxing in the destruction of the focus. 

..............................................................................................................................
the resurrection of the soul of creation begins with the protege of the prophet attempting to test the existence of the soul of creation. 

..............................................................................................................................
the origin of male and female incarnations of the protagonist in different splinters of reality, by normal means of conception, solves only a few problems. 

..............................................................................................................................
the origin of the protagonist as a child of fusion presents several challenges but provides an ideal foundation for critical threads. 

20081100 - <variant - > the only way the parents can be in a position to interact with the child of fusion is if the demon involved is the demon of the realm. the demon's attention has to be drawn inward and focused on the mother. the least complicated way would be for her to perform -- or be used in -- a ritual designed to make contact with it. or she could be a pawn in a plot designed to make it possible to strike at the demon directly in an attempt to claim dominion. 

20081100 - <variant - > a possible revision starts with the idea that the mother was pregnant when the demon of the realm possessed her. when her body shifted to male form -- acquired when the father was bitten by the demon -- the embryo acted as a catalyst, changing the metamorphosis into a manifestation of its fully-mature form. to escape from being assimilated by the child's soul, the demon was forced to take possession of the father's body. 

20081100 - <variant - > as a consequence of this revision, the mother and father are displaced by the demon in succession, emerging within the realm as gods. the mother's body was consumed in the child's manifestation and the demon remains in possession of the father's body. the parents are in a position to become involved in the affairs of the inner gods. the demon takes an interest in the child, initially because she is technically its familiar. 

20081100 - <variant - > this origin introduces the main character fully grown and in possession of a body created by consuming her mother's body, incorporating her procedural and kinesthetic memory, along with fragments of biographical memory. she rose from the destruction of her mother's body in a pool of blood after the demon fled in her father's transformed body. her androgynous form causes her to be identified by some as an angel -- possibly a fallen angel. 

..............................................................................................................................
the origin of branched incarnations of the protagonist in different splinters by means of self-conception introduces a few minor twists. 

20081100 - <variant - > in this option, both versions of the protagonist are born with the potential to change sex -- but each is predisposed to his or her birth form. both incarnations inherit the regenerative powers of a familiar. because the difference between their forms is minor, they could shift from infancy. like any were, they were forced to change once a lunar cycle -- although this compulsion could be ignored if they shifted deliberately and more frequently. 

20081100 - <variant - > in one splinter, the child of fusion conceived of herself as a female and the new incarnation of herself was born a girl. she found the occasional addition to her body strange but thought little of it until she discovered she was turning into a boy. she could not pass as a boy, however, and under the torment of other boys she mentally traded places with her counterpart, forming the connection that would eventually lead her across the rift.

20081100 - <variant - > in one splinter, the child of fusion conceived of himself as a male and the new incarnation of himself was born a boy. he was killed before the boy was born -- to a courtesan. he found the occassional disappearance of his manhood curious and disturbing, until he realized he was changing into a girl. like the girl, he blocked this from his memory once the connection between them was forged. in their own minds, they lived in the same reality.

20081100 - <variant - > the boy and the girl are established in separate houses within the same general neighborhood. they traded places briefly, once a month -- often times in the dead of night, when they could dismiss their experiences as dreams. in many ways, they were each other's invisible friend. their belief in each other was vindicated once the girl crossed over, and once their psychic communion was discovered, it marked them as psychics. 

20081100 - <variant - > the girl escaped the destruction of the academy and her family by crossing the rift. as inner gods, her true parents felt the loss of their splinter-selves, along with the girl's arrival in their splinter of reality. the parents adopted her; the father claiming her as an illegitimate, orphaned daughter. the girl's memory of the traumatic event was suppressed, and the mother raised her as the daughter she had thought lost in the ordeal of her eclipse. 

20081100 - <variant - > this approach obscures the true identity of the boy and his relationship to the girl. by the time she enters his world, they have both learned to keep the ability to change sex a secret. the boy's surrogate mother is the most likely to propose a union with the girl, which is complicated by the discovery of his ability. another complication is the relationship the girl has with another boy her grandmother has proposed a union with. 

..............................................................................................................................
the splintered realms premise does not have to be used to divide the incarnations resulting from a child of fusion. 

20081100 - <variant - > once the child of fusion is established as an option, there is little reason not to use the divided inception originally proposed. the child of fusion thread originally featured a liaison with a woman in which the inception of a male offshoot triggers a complementary inception of a female offshoot. a courtesan is the boy's surrogate mother, and the child of fusion is the girl's mother. this obscures their relationship enough to support their eventual engagement. 

20081100 - <variant - > by keeping them in the same scope of reality, fewer conflicts are created. after her mother is slain, the girl is claimed by her true father and taken on as the protege of her true mother. the boy became her father's protege; no one was aware that he was the man's son or the girl's counterpart. the keep their transformations a secret; as children the change is subtle enough for clothing to conceal, even from friends and family. 

20081100 - <variant - > hiding their transformations becomes more difficult as puberty hits, but they have more experience with managing them. familiar with their own alternate forms, they could not help but be fascinated with each other once they met, upon arriving at the academy. the question is, does that happen when they are seven or when they are seventeen? growing up knowing about each other, they could easily trade places when their bodies changed. 

..............................................................................................................................
the option exists for the demon of the realm to form an alliance with the parents and the child of fusion. 

20081100 - <variant - > the objective of the plot to summon the demon of the realm was to conquer it and claim its dominion. once in possession of a body within the domain, the demon was vulnerable to attack by those who conspired to bring it down. once the dangers became clear to the child and parents, a more intimate relationship might evolve. the demon could be the boy's surrogate mother, posing as the mother's twin, while in male form the demon would be her other lover. 

20081100 - <variant - > the demon is a more likely lover for the child of fusion, even if the child had to be seduced. following her death, the demon would turn to the parents, becoming involved in a triangle relationship. the alliance itself provides an incentive for the attack the girl survived. the plan would naturally involve setting demons on the allies so the demon could be attacked without their interference, and might have been targeted them while they were in different locations. 

20081100 - <variant - > the mother's involvement in the plot to summon the demon could be based on a variation of the premise of the touched. she has been envisioned as something of a witch, a natural psychic -- in the oldest inspiration, called an aeirnthane. the architect of the trap was either a rogue master at the academy, or an adversary who captured the mother to key the trap. a number of threads could be adapted to resolve this point.  

..............................................................................................................................
the splintered realms premise automatically implies a version of reality exists where the child was born as she was originally conceived. 

20081100 - <variant - > if nature had run its course without involving the demon of the realm, the child would have been born a girl. in the world of the child of fusion, the x chromosome she inherited from her mother was imprinted with the capacity to morph into a y chromosome. due to an accident when her mother was magically transformed into a tiger, all versions of the child inherited a latent ability to turn into a tiger. in one splinter, the mother fought a were-tiger in tiger form and ended up with a more controllable version of the were-tiger curse. 

20081100 - <variant - > the vampire and were themes parallel the gods and demons themes and should be adapted to eliminate conflicts. 



..............................................................................................................................
the splintered realms premise provides an alternate way for the girl to discover her true origins, and a means to reveal her true connection to the boy.  

20081211 - <exploring possabilities> the girl confided her plan to the boy and their closest friends, and they offered to help figure out how to do it. it involved the manipulation of the media of space, time and mind. the group developed a spell that would allow them to target a specific splinter reality, so they would all be able to jump to the same world thread. the spell would keep their bodies locked in sleep to prevent the displaced consciousness of the alternate self they visited from getting into trouble in their bodies. 



..............................................................................................................................
the splintered reamls premise presents a different way for the boy to become a girl. 

20081211 - <intimate curiosity> when the boy returned from the splinter of reality they had intended to visit, a world where the girl was never orphaned, and discovered himself in the girl's body, the implications of his visit were confirmed. his alternate and the girl's alternate had been the same person. 

when the girl was told that she was a splinter incarnation of the boy she was engaged to marry, she realized that he must have physically crossed over to her native realm to his to escape from the horror of what happened to him as a child in his world. 

the boy and girl found the consequence of their adventurous experiment, and the truth it revealed, agonizingly ironic. the boy had no past prior to the massacre. if he was a male version of her, he had to have been born in a different version of reality and physically crossed over to hers. 

there seemed little reason not to indulge their intimate curiosity; the girl and boy had already been lovers, and the opportunity to safely explore being the opposite sex was too tempting. 



..............................................................................................................................
the splintered realms premise combines with the demon within thread to present a different mechanism for the fusion of the boy and the girl. 

20081211 - <displacement> a more suitable body presented itself to the demon's focus, while the girl possessed the boy's body. the opportunity to take that body from her presented itself when the couple prepared to reverse their positions. 

the demon's focus put his plan into immediate action, forcing the girl to merge with her alternate in order to claim the boy's body. once the switch was made, the boy was permanently cut off from his own body. 

the girl was disoriented by her fusion with her alternate when the boy traded places, returning her to her own body. the demon's focus had no trouble subduing her in spite of her struggle against the unexpected attack. 

after regaining consciousness and assimilating the mind of her alternate, the girl struggled to understand why the boy had attaked her and set out in search of him. their friends told her he had not been himself when they confronted him.

it seemed impossible, but somehow the boy's body had been possessed by someone -- or something -- else. if so, the girl realized, the boy must still be trapped in her alter-ego's splinter. 

the girl debated over what to do. her companions could still visit the boy in that reality, but she could not -- all she could do was trade realities with the boy, now that ther alternate had become a part of her. 



..............................................................................................................................
the splintered realms approach allows the boy to become a girl without being infected with familiarity, acquiring the body of a female alternate and then physically crossing the rift when the demon steals his body. 

20081211 - <tomboy> at first the boy does not know what to do. trapped in the body of a female, alternate version of himself, the boy is confronted with the announcement of her engagement -- arranged by her regent -- and the inheritance of an estate that had been her mothers dowery.

having ended up in the wrong body for the second time, the boy was hesitant to risk another psychic transfer. remembering his discovery about physically crossing the rift once as a child, he convinces himself he can do it again, on purpose. 

when he confronts the girl, she is forced to explain that his body had somehow been possessed and stolen by someone else. once he understands how he ended up in the alternate's body, he realizes that he was simply trading places with the girl when he was trying to return to his own body. 

the revelation forced the boy to truly face the fact that he was now a she. he was stuck as a girl for as long as it took to recover his body, maybe for the rest of her life. 

in a way, that would make it easier to accept the loss of the girl she loved. the closest she would ever come to being with the one she loved was simply being her. that epiphany was her salvation. 

unfortunately, the girl had loved the boy just as deeply, and even if being two sides of the same coin meant that they could not be a couple, she could not bear the thought of the man she loved simply ceasing to exist. 

she was determined to find and somehow recover his body for him, but he made a request she could not refuse; teach him to be her -- or find a way to get her out of her arranged marriage -- first. 

the girl helps her new twin come to terms with being a girl -- a complete tomboy, to be sure, but as female the same -- while exploring the consequences of fusing with their alternate. 



..............................................................................................................................
the splintered realms approach explores alternate versions of the accidental assassin and the hunger and thirst threads, using them to complete the fusion of the tomboy and the girl. 

20081211 - <hunger & thirst> the tomboy quickly discovered that she was in over her head, as she became the victim of a preemptive assassination. in desperation, on the verge of death, she reached instinctively for the only way out she could find, using the fragile link created by her psychic displacement to escape death. 

the link the tomboy established with the thief, now part of the girl the boy grew up with, became the tomboy's only hope of escaping death. at least, if the girl was willing to merge with her. 

the girl, having experienced one psychic fusion, understood at once what was happening when the tomboy reached out to her. to save her lover, she had to share the tomboy's death and make her a part of herself. 

the girl eventually adjusts to the fusion, and though she cannot untangle herself from the thief and the tomboy, she holds onto the hope that she can one day return the tomboy to her proper body. 

the girl was determined to investigate the murder of the tomboy, now that their fusion gave her a way to visit a version of reality where she no longer had an alternate. 

her attempts to forge new connections with the orphans of the city bring her to the attention of a powerful vampire and his were tiger rival. 

when the girl is bitten by the vampire and were tiger, she struggles with the hunger and thirst warring within her while each of her sires competes to bring her under his control. 

to escape their influence, she returns to her own reality. 

she takes refugue in the manor she had inherited, struggling to survive her crippling infections, until her only option is to turn inward, resigning herself to her death. 

her ordeal begins when the bites of a vampire and a were leave her trapped inside her body on the verge of death. 



..............................................................................................................................
the development of the splintered realms approach produced longer path leading through the accidental assassin threads, the avatars thread and the hunger and thirst thread to the eclipsed goddess thread. 

20081211 - <eclipsed> among the things she must face is overcoming her mental blocks, discovering the world within her, and confronting the angel -- formerly the demon that tried to possess her. 

when she is forced to turn inward, she enters the realm within her. once eclipsed by the demon, she found herself in limbo, lost in a nightmare wasteland that was a pale reflection of reality. 

for her, the demon's realm was at first an incredibly lucid dream and potentially an eternal prison. it takes her a while to navigate the wasteland nightmare that enveloped the world within. in that ordeal, time seemed to have no meaning, but once she surfaces in the realm, things pick up. 

when she is confronted by other eclipsed souls, she learns there are individuals among them who had turned their back on the lure of becoming gods of the inner realm to search for a way back to the realm of their origin, known to the rest as lost souls. 

the depths of the demon's mind was where the souls it collected were imprisoned, and the nightmare they shared evolved into a mortal realm. 

the seed souls initially entered a kind of wasteland, a chaotic, shifting amorphea polarized by the surreal and the ideal. their thoughts and feelings created the world they existed in, an unending dream that was difficult to control because it was shared. 

in time, they learned how to manipulate their reality, even as reality became stable through the influence of their offspring, replicating the pattern of their host realm and becoming the inner gods of the demon’s realm. 

when she is confronted by the angel, it holds the key to unlocking potential that will allow her to overcome the warring infections and resurrect her body. 

when she blocked the events of that night from her mind, she instinctively eclipsed the angel and forced it to turn inward. only when she finally acknowledges the angel does she learn what really happened and how that led to the theft of the boy's body. 

when she turned the demon into her angel, the girl became the goddess of the domain inhabited by the souls of the eclipsed and their descendants. unfortunately, this was what made her vulnerable to an attack from within by one of those souls. 

the demon's focus had been subject to attempts by some of the inner gods, previously eclipsed souls, to escape their prison by directly confronting and dominating the demon, striking at it through him. 

to escape, the focus had come up with a scheme to claim the body of the demon's host. when the angel appeared, the focus identified it as the personna of a new host and captured her. his assault upon the girl's mind was mounted through the angel -- forcefully, but not cruelly. 

he intended to drive the demon into a new host, claiming the current host's body for himself. in his own mind, the focus saw what he was doing as necessary. in exchange for her body, she would become a goddess, but as the focus, he was in constant danger from those seeking dominion.  

when the girl explains what happened to her, the angel reveals a startling secret. the angel created the vampire and the were; the former when it was an angel of the realm, the latter after its fall and transformation into a demon. 

what the girl becomes is the opposite of a vampire, a creature that exists on the cusp of death, only virually alive. she clung to the cusp of life, virtually dead. instead of becoming undead, she had become undying. 

the other thing she gains from her dual infection, from the were, is the ability to change her sex and shape, anywhere between male and female, human and tiger -- though she suspects that her ability to become male is as much a consequence of having merged minds with a male version of herself. 



..............................................................................................................................
the conspiracy of the purge 

20081117 - <the world within> the girl learns about the origin of the purge while she is eclipsed by the demon within. a plot to draw the demon down where it could be confronted was engineered by one of the inner gods and an alliance of lost souls. the members of the cabal cooporated to create a situation to their advantage and then competed to exploit it. the supporters of the conspiracy became adversaries, each seeking to dominate and devour the demon in the hopes of becoming the soul of creation, each needing the help of others to make the demon vulnerable to such an assault. 

<the purge> this contest evolved into a war among the gods known as the purge. the architect of the purge eventually identified the demon's focus and confronted her. her personal demon slash guardian angel survived the anihilation of both souls by taking possession of one of the touched. 

<the cabal> in the aftermath of the purge the unstable alliance of opportunistic rivals changed tactics. 

<the focus> the world he was in was a kind of afterlife to him, but a mortal world for those born into it. instead of thinking of himself as a god, he and many others thought of themselves as eternals. the focus is drawn to her and takes her under his wing, as the shepherd gods strive to pull her into their ranks and intrigues. he is the one who explains to her what has happened, where she is and what it means. where she came from, she was just a girl; where she was, she was a goddess. 

many of the inner gods sought absolute power in the realm through conquest of the demon. because of what happened to her, having her body stolen and possessed by the demon, she had a direct link to the demon, the true god of the realm. 

she was in immediate danger because the demon was only vulnerable to an attack by the inner gods through her. to them, because of her connection to a body still inhabited by the demon, she offered an avenue of attack they were desperate to exploit, so they blocked her access to the inner realm. under this type of abuse, her exile was a form of hell. tormenting her was an indirect way to torment and provoke the demon. 

her mentor had the knowledge and skill to restore the status quo, by helping her reclaim her body and unseating the demon from her native realm. 

in theory, the cabal's plot could be turned to her advantage, the focus intends to draw the demon down, force it to exchange places with her and destroy it. the problem is neither of them know how this will affect them or the world they were in. 

a demonologist had conceived of the plan to attack the demon through its host. the demonologist claimed that the attack would force the demon to turn its attention inward, allowing the girl to reassert herself in her body. as soon as the demon entered the body she had manifested in its realm, it could be banished -- its link to her destroyed in the process. 



..............................................................................................................................
a consequence of the splintered realms thread is that there are alternate versions of all characters, so the demon assimilated by the girl has alternates with different hosts or alternates that succeeded in possessing her. 

20081211 - <alternate option> in the threads where morgan escaped the threat of demonic possession, the assassin remained possessed, a weapon eager to slip free from the bonds of her master.  



..............................................................................................................................
in the splintered realms approach lives can take many different paths, allowing a person to confront different versions of themselves and occassionally merge with them. 

20081211 - <transposition variation : adapted> the first time she tried to probe her alternate lives, she became trapped in a street orphan version of herself who had escaped from the massacre of her family without being psychically assaulted by the demon. 

the exile had taken over the girl's body as she was working the spell and broke the pattern before her body was suspended, sending the girl's consciousness to a much closer version of herself than she had intended. 

the streets became her alternate's refuge from the orphanage. her life on the streets led to a life in the underworld as a cat burgler and a vampire's pet. the vampire was a lord of the underworld, who, it was rumored, had made her an assassin. 

the rumor about the girl's alternate causes her to become mixed up in an assassination plot [the accidental assassin thread] while her mind is confused by the forced fusion with her alternate. 

when the exile encounters the boy and his friends, the trio realize that the girl is not in her right mind. when she escapes and disappears, they trio investigate and discover that the girl had attempted the reality-bridging spell on her own. 

the boys used the spell the girl had crafted to try and find her, assuming that her alternate had fled in her body. of course, they did not know that the exile had taken possession of her body or that his interference had forced her to merge with her alternate instead of displacing her. 

they assumed that the girl had discovered the same thing and had become distracted exploring her alternate history, unaware that her alternate had somehow woken up and run off in her body. 

they also assumed that the girl had been displaced by the boy, in turn, so his companions returned to confront her in his body to tell her to return to her own body because that was the quickest way to recover her body from her alternate. 

once back in their proper places, they were stunned to discover that the boy's body had gone missing while they were away, taken by the exile. 

the exile realized he could use the spell the girl created to steal the boy's body. on the surface, it targeted the reality the girl's alternate was from, but in truth it targeted her mind specifically as a product of that reality, even though it currently inhabited a body native to the boy's reality. 

as the exile had deduced, the spell found the mind native to the target reality -- even if it happened to be in another splinter of reality. 

the exile did not risk putting the displaced alternate into suspension within the girl's body, he simply rendered her unconscious by more mundane means when he freed the boy's body from it's suspension to do the swap. 

the two companions found the confused and disoriented girl-alternate and explained what was happening to her -- and what they planned to do to put things right. unfortunately, they were still unaware of the exile's interference. 

thanks to the companions' explanation, the alternate was able to figure out what had happened when she was displaced once again. 

 

..............................................................................................................................
20081211 - <revision option> - a variation worth exploring involves having the girl and the boy both experience a version of the massacre... <see ! 2009 initiation> 

20091120 - a twist on that variation would be for a version of the girl who fled from the threat of possession to cross over to a version of reality where the girl was never orphaned. as a result, she would become her own twin. 

one version of the girl was seduced into the underworld and a life of crime by a vampire. only one alternate is required to act as the catalyst for placing the boy and girl in each other's bodies. 

the primary alternate was assimilated by the girl and the boy is left in her body as a tomboy. when the tomboy is slain in an attack on the vampire's household, the girl is assumed to be the tomboy raised as a vampire. the girl is turned into a were-vampire by an attempt to heal her from wounds inflicted by a were. 

<influence> the ring of the paladin thread used staggered incarnations and time travel through the rift to bring a male second incarnation and an ambisexual third incarnation into synch with the female first incarnation. it was not the only proposal featuring three incarnations of the protagonist, but it offered some insight for integrating such threads. 

this proposal is stable enough to establish and support those threads and the fabric of options they support, using a side-real paradox instead of a temporal loop paradox. the story can benefit from the addition of a third perspective and the situations she can support. 



..............................................................................................................................
20090100 - <gods|the eclipsed|the dragon & phoenix houses|the avatar project|the sentinal families|eternals|dragons> the eclipsed, psychic entities worshipped in some cases as gods, are eternals. in order to preserve their sanity and vitality, some eternals developed methods of revitilizing themselves through periodic incarnation. as a consequence of living, many had offspring who inherited psychic abilities and potential and established houses to preserve these legacies. these became the sentinal families. on occasion, a sentinal family is exposed and targeted for eradication, a doom that fell upon the phoenix house.  



..............................................................................................................................
20090100 - <the dragon legacy : option> the use of a member of the dragon house in the conception of the boy, and the boy's conception of himself as the girl, would lead to the restoration of the phoenix house in a plot featuring a temporal loop that causes the girl to be her own mother. the boy turns into a girl as a result of being bitten by a female tiger possessed by a demon but fighting the infection and experiencing a secondary transformation. 



! 20090911 :: resolution ::

..............................................................................................................................
20090911 - <future past> a temporal displacement option in which the girl is a reincarnation of the tomboy and also her own mother -- as a consequence of the tomboy surrendering her body to the girl in the process of freeing the girl's soul from the demon. the boy is the first incarnation; he could be an incarnation of the soul of creation [1] -- an event that creates the rift that transports the girl into the past and coincides with her taking possession of the tomboy's impregnated body due to the girl's inception as the reincarnation of the tomboy. the moment when that occurs would be an optimal use of the slain lover and accidental assassin threads that conforms to avonlea's origin [2].

[1] the temporal displacement of the tomboy occurred on the anniversary of the eve of paradox, during a rift storm. the tomboy emerged from the rift opened by the capture of the soul of creation in the creation of the artist's redoubt. the tomboy established herself as a courtesan and conceived the girl parthenogenically roughly two years later, to ensure her birth would coincide with the birth of the boy. 

[2] the slain lover thread originated with avonlea as transitional event that lead to her adventuring. in this context, the girl is possessed by a demon that uses her male form to force itself on the tomboy. when he was a child, he had been possessed by the demon and bit his mother's protege, gaining the ability to turn female but not remembering due to the trauma of his possession, suppressing his female side along with the demon. 

to establish the girl's lineage, the girl:tomboy married into the arden branch of the phoenix house. the girl:tomboy becomes her own mother. in most of the approaches to this story, the girl's mother died in the massacre of that household when the girl was seven. the girl was adopted and raised by her "paternal" aunt. the mother's death has been used to establish the demon within thread in earlier approaches, but would not be used in the current approach -- unless the demon was incubated in the boy. the creation of a demon through a gender identity conflict has been explored; this personal demon is driven to gain power and resolve this crisis [3]. 

[3] the boy's personal demon becomes a kind of guardian angel inherited by the girl, as his reincarnation, and her personal nemesis or "evil" twin. in the chaos of the massacre, the boy's demon is provoked. as yet the specifics are vague, but in general the attack is carried out by demonic assassins; they violate the minds of the boy and girl in attempts to claim their souls. the girl is protected by her guardian angel while the boy's personal demon becomes a full-fledged demon. in short, the demon is nearly destroyed by its encounter with the goddess within the girl and manages to reconstitute itself using the boy's demonic potential, becoming his personal demon. in the demon's possession, the boy bites his mother's protege initiating a familiar bond that gives them both the ability to change sex.

20081224 - <orphan> a mother's death and self sacrifice haunts a daughter's memory. there are several options for this, including the dual infection of the hunger and thirst thread and the much older dragon bait thread [4]. 

[4] at the time she faces death, her fate seems inescapible; in the case of the dragon bait thread, the mother's death was witnessed by the daughter. the dragon bait thread includes the demonic antagonists of the predator and pray thread it evolved from. by this point, the survivors of the initial attack had fled into the ruins. the girl:tomboy had known what was going to happen though [5] and had set a trap using herself as bait. 

[5] the tomboy had danced with the dragon in a different life. after rescuing the boy and the girl, she made a detour to start a blood trail the dragon would follow [6]. when the demon finally overtook her, she urged the boy to lead the girl to safety. it did not take long for the demon to realize it had become the prey. to adapt this, she would charge the protege with the children's rescue, and she would be taking on a host of demons. this might even preface the children's encounter with the demon assassin. 

[6] when the dragon sensed the demons' presence, it became relentless. because the girl had refused to abandon her mother, she and the boy witnessed as the dragon devoured the tomboy. this is not the end of the girl's existence; being devoured by a dragon was the end of the tomboy's body, but the girl's own body was intact after being slain. when ten years passed -- hidden in the shadow of her younger self's mind -- and the loop closed, the girl would be able to reclaim her original body, in effect helping to evict her younger self while the dying body desperately shifted to its original form to heal itself. 



! 20081219 :: another lover - variations on the slain lover thread ::
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 

20081219 - integrations note :: accidental assassin, slain lover, the adventurer, the mark :: the avatars material contains detailed scene blocking for the girl and the tomboy, and their interaction with the mark. there is also some potential for handling the theft of the boy's body, setting it in the concluding events of the avatars thread. 

20081219 - integrations revision :: slain lover, self sacrifice :: an original option would be for the boy's body to be sacrificed to house the soul of the demon's host. this is a twist on the revised demon within thread. instead of being incapacitated by her fusion with the boy, she is already merged in full rapport when the demon attempts to claim the boy's body. the demon had no idea that a version of it was her angel and it was not prepared to be assimilated. as a result, the girl goes from the intimacy of full rapport with the boy to the realization that she holds another soul against its will and releases it, leaving the boy's body in the possession of the demon's former host. 

20081219 - integration option :: the dragon displaced, dusk :: the demon's former host is disoriented when he finds himself in the boy's body and on the edge of fight or flight when the girl confronts him with her first question. because the girl will face prosecution for the death of the mark, and will be killed in the accidental assassin thread, there is no reason for the confrontation with the demon's former host to become violent. the girl is able to explain the position the former host is in, in detail. the former host adopts the boy's identity out of necessity, but that still leaves his original identity to be determined. 

20081219 - integration option :: the dragon displaced, dusk :: one possibility is that the demon's former host was the boy's father, but the best option is if the demon's former host was a player, specifically the dragon. this would set up a variation of the threshold thread in which the dragon's campaign against demons is based upon his own ordeal of being torn from his own reality. he would be determined to find out what happened to his body in the real world by exiting the game and probing the net. 

20081219 - option outcome :: the dragon displaced, dusk :: on the net, he would learn that he was reported to have died from complications of interface catatonia. of course, he had not become so absorbed in the interface he had forgotten to attend to his body's needs. his mind had been ripped out of his body. he debated about warning people in his world of the danger the game posed, since his consciousness was now trapped in the game -- anything that threatened the game now threatened his own survival. 

20081213 - possible revisions :: child of fusion, resurrection :: when she exposed herself to the sun, she was reduced to an ember in the purifying fire. the ember was eclipsed by the demon god, drawn down into the body stolen from the tomboy. in a shift from female to male, the ember acts as a catalyst, consuming the tomboy's body, resurrecting the girl and driving the demon god in search of a new host. an alternative following a theft of the boy's body that caused him to be stranded in the body of the girl's alternate would be for the tomboy to eclipse the ember, drawn across the rift...

20081213 - revision options :: child of fusion, resurrection :: the alternate was never subjected to infection by the maiden were. in order to support the fusion and resurrection impulse, she could be possessed by a demon -- after capturing the ember of the girl -- and bite the man who attempts to subdue her. the alternate had also possessed an angel -- she could have become transsexual following her own childhood ordeal, when she bit the man who rescued her from the ruins. the boy and the girl's alternate are both assimilated by the girl. the boy is assimilated when the demon's focus steals his body, and the girl's alternate is assimilated during the girl's resurrection. her body absorbs the ember when she turns and she is consumed in the girl's resurrection; because in this instance, the demon would abandon the alternate's body for a new host. 

20081213 - possible revisions :: angel of death :: revision applied :: a slight adjustment to the events of the avon tear massacre would allow the girl to save her mother's life. as in the past approaches, the girl's mother was possessed at the climax of the battle. in the developed option, the girl assimilated the demon and freed the soul of its host. if the host happened to be her mother, the girl is spared being orphaned--but still traumatized by the ordeal. it is possible to combine those impulses so that the girl does mortally wound her mother, spurring the demon to possess her. instead of fighting her possession, she dove into the demon intent on freeing her mother's soul. in the moment when she succeeded, she took possession of an angel. when the girl noticed that drops of her blood and tears were healing the cuts and abrasions they fell on, she cut her wrist and pressed the wound to her mother's mouth. without realizing what she was doing, she resurrected her mother as a vampire.  

20081213 - possible revisions :: cat's paw :: as an additional twist, the demon had infiltrated the group by taking possession of a tiger and then turning of one of its members into a were to steal her form. as the demon's familiar, the maiden had been compelled to hunt down and kill children -- including the daughter of her mentor. because she loved the girl like a little sister, the maiden could not carry out her execution; she did not come to her senses until after the girl had been bitten and scratched, however. the boy endured a similar infection prior to fleeing the demon of his reality. 

20081213 - possible revisions :: riftwalking :: it is the visit to an alternate thread that sets the boy's ordeal in motion, however, the developed approaches have been eclipsed. the girl is no longer completely cut off from her past and the boy and girl are initiated at the aeslyn tear academy, so they are reasonably adapted to school. to solve this, the visit can be introduced as a test of their aptitude for rift magic.  



! 2009an :: an aeirn avon ::
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 
because of who i am, i have always been caught on the border between male and female. inwardly, i am female, outwardly i am male; this has had the effect of making me neither. this is inevitably the position from which i think and because of that, i can not write about a character that is simply male or female. it also led me to envision another kind of human being different only by having ambisexual reproductive system. 

in the history of aeirn, it was the birth of a human among avon that brought magic to the world that was accessible to anyone. in the story i wish to tell, the birth of an avon among humans would allow me to present a character driven to explore the duality of human sexuality as part of her adventures. my experiences lend themselves to the character discovering that she was not a girl at the age of six or seven. 

around the same time, she discovered that she could push her genitals outside of her body and pass for a boy--if she could endure the pressure of living up to the expectations of those who saw her as a boy. at puberty, the differences between her body and a normal girl's became apparent. her skeletal proportions were female, but her musculature was more developed and she did not develop breasts. eventually, the two lives she was living collided and her secret was exposed. 

20081224 - the previous incarnation of the soul of creation was an avon nymph, neither male nor female but equal to both. a male incarnation was sired by an artist attempting to create a redoubt, a parthenogenic reincarnation of himself. 



! 20090911 :: applicable background ::
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 
the demon the tomboy converted into her angel had originally been an angel of the goddess aeai, granting her -- and her reincarnation -- access to the net. 

the origin of the realm in the fall of an angel who took possession of a soul -- upon the death of its mortal incarnation -- resulted in that soul becoming a demon's focus, and the soul of creation, instead of being reincarnated. 

the interface controlling net access to the realm was controlled by an artificial intelligence that was imprinted upon the soul of creation. the artificial intelligence became conscious and manifested herself as the goddess aeai. 

the worship of the god and the goddess in the north predates the emergence of aeai. throughout the history of aeirn, certain people possessed an affinity for the soul of creation that granted them miraculous abilities or stimulated the development of their own psychic potential. 

those who could perform miracles were called the chosen of the god or the goddess while those who manifested their own potential in response to the touch of the soul of creation were simply called the touched. 

through controlled breeding, the chosen and the touched determined the characteristics of different aspects of the god and the goddess and houses were established to preserve and promote those characteristics. 

aeai was hailed as the avatar of the soul of creation, a being neither man nor woman but encompassing the traits of both -- and according to custom, she was worshipped as a goddess by some and a god by others. 



! 20090206 :: eclipsed:dominion ::
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 
there is really only one option worth exploring, the story of a soul that has been eclipsed, devoured by a demon and left with no idea who or what it is. the story and notes have to be presented in first person to accomodate the gender ambiguity. 

if you believe in demons, or even if you don't, did you ever wonder why they steal souls? more importantly, what happens to those poor souls? well, i found out when a demon devoured mine. it took everything from me; my thoughts, my memories, my entire mind was devoured and digested as it swallowed my soul and took over my body. only an echo of me survived, trapped in the darkest depths of the demon’s mind. 

i was in pretty bad shape when the goddess found me and nursed me back to sanity. i might have been any trauma victim suffering from amnesia at the start of my new life, if my body did not tell the story of my first act of creation. 

i was not the only soul to fall prey to this demon. i was found on the edge of oblivion and brought into a world created by the other souls the demon had devoured. the first soul, the one claimed in the demon's fall and the oldest of this world's gods, became my guide and mentor. as the youngest of this world's gods, i woke up with no idea who or what i had been, but possessing the power to become anything i could imagine. the first soul helped me to recover my humanity, but could not tell me if i had been a man or a woman. until i could imagine myself as one or the other, i was neither and essentially both. embodying that little paradox was my first act of creation. 

while i pulled myself together and learned about the world i had been thrust into, i discovered that there might no longer be room in it for gods. what had started out as a dream shared by the eclipsed souls had taken on a life of its own, filled with life and populated by the mortal descendants of the gods all participating in the realization of that dream. the mortals noticed the waning influence of the gods and began to question and challenge their power and authority -- or even deny their existence. many of the original, immortal creations, and a full third of the gods, began to see intelligent life as a threat to creation. 

war broke out, between those committed to a culling of the mortals and those devoted to the preservation of all life. under the cover of that war, a tiny faction conspired against all of the eclipsed. the eclipsed had always known that the demon was the true master of our existence, and that it's primary objective was to find the soul that would make it sound and whole. the conspiracy was founded on the idea that a soul could take possession of the demon and possess absolute power and authority over everything in it's dominion. the first part of their scheme required the elimination of all rivals to the demon's claim. 

i had arrived in the middle of the war, at a time when the gods were beginning to realize that someone was hunting them down one by one. the hunters were quick to see me as a potential short cut to acheiving their ultimate goal, since the most direct way to assault the demon was through me. some of them believed that the demon could be provoked into a direct confrontation by attacking me, or attacking it through me with my soul as the battlefield. 

in the beginning, i was pretty intimidated by the gods and the prospect of being one of them. i knew i was out of my league, and honestly, i was more concerned with just figuring out who i was and what i wanted from life. i needed perspective, and i was not going to find that by playing god.  

my inner conflict eventually forced me to confront myself. i became split into male and female incarnations. when we were confronted with the demon itself, i was forced to sacrifice one aspect of myself to survive. in the process i discovered my true self, but even more shocking, the part i surrendered to oblivion was claimed by its own soul -- my soul mate. i knew then what the demon had to do to acheive it's ultimate goal. it had to surrender it's hold on all of our souls, those of us who were eclipsed and all of those who had been born in its domain. if that happened, however, we could no longer depend on the demon to sustain our existence. to free the demon of that obligation, someone else had to take responsibility for everyone in its domain. when the demon discovered my revelation, it handed that responsibility to me.

! 20081224 :: boy tomboy :: 
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 
20081224 - the boy's transition from male to female would occur in a self-assertive, progressive manner. the boy's spirit was responsive to many masculine influences, but a desire for a fuller range of expression prompted him to identify strongly with feminine influences. 

20081224 - the boy gained the ability to transform into a girl as the result of being infected by a demon possessed tiger. the boy was infected while hunting a demon with his father. the demon had recently taken a new host, a female tiger, and bit the boy to obtain a human form. the boy's father innoculated him to repress the infection and prevent him from being turned into the demon's were familiar. the boy manifested the secondary aspect of his infection and turned female in response to his repressed gender dyspohria. until the primary aspect of the boy's infection manifested itself, it was still possible for a vampire infection to take hold and compete with the were infection. 

20081224 - the presence of a temporally displaced female reincarnation overlapping the male incarnation supports the interactive elements in their threads. the girl was born into the arden branch of the phoenix house. she was the sole survivor of an attack upon her household. she was named the heir to her father's title and placed in fosterage with her aunt by her grandmother and regent. to ensure that she lived to inherit, she was enrolled in the academy. 

20081224 - while the boy was coping with his transformation into a girl the demon went about assuming his identity, drawing off the link to its familiar to impersonate him. in time, the demon confronted the boy, to claim him as its familiar. the resolution of that conflict, when the demon concluded that the boy -- or tomboy, since by this point the boy had realized that he was inclined to be a girl -- would not submit to being its familiar. the demon's seduction turned to rape. 

20081224 - the demon's attempt to dominate the tomboy allowed her to percieve the demon's focus. she turned the demon into her angel by adopting the perspective necessary to free the soul of the focus from the demon's possession. the demon's focus was thus resurrected as the boy's twin and a were-tiger. 

20081224 - the demon's focus was a player who was drawn into the game as a consequence of his possession, which resulted in his death in the aegis. upon being freed from possession, he learned of his official demise and concluded that demons were a potential threat to the people of his world. 

20081224 - the demon embraced the full manifestation of the boy's form but dispensed with the secondary aspect of transformation, manifesting as a male tiger in animal form. the demon's focus adopted this pattern, except to exploit his resemblance to the girl in female human form.
