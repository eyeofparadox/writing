splinters of reality 

:. Perhaps the greatest oversight in the development of this project has been a tendency to overlook one of its earliest inspirations. Aeirn began as the setting for a story in which, among other things, the male and female incarnations of the same person meet and merge into one. The mechanism for this was a manifestation of paradox, the rift. Instead of pondering how those two ideas disintegrated, it is time to look at the ideas that have emerged to see how they are affected by the restoration of that inspiration. 

:. Only recently, the cataclysm and the creation of the rift have been tied together as the climax of the purge, a conflict among the gods that marks the end of the age of creation and the beginning of the age of ruin. In short, the demon that is the host of the realm was drawn into the conflict by the destruction of the soul that was its focus. 

The rift is the manifestation of the shattering blow that splintered reality. 

:. The splintering of reality provides an explanation for the existence of different versions of the same people. In particular, it allows the vampire and were-tiger threads to be isolated yet based on the same character. It even works out that the game construct exploits the splintering of Aeirn, which is potentially infinite, as if the splinters of reality were different servers. 

The gods, by chance and choice, were scattered among the splinter realms. They had the ability to cross the rift between splinter realms, and used it to hunt or hide from each other in the contest that followed the purge. 

The gods can be distinguished from angels and demons primarily by the nature of their introduction. 

The angels of the realm are the personal demon of the inner gods. They are fragments or fractals of the demon implanted in the souls of the eclipsed -- artifacts of their possession. 

The demons of the realm were originally angels, but they acted on the impulse to possess souls of their own and broke off from the host to fulfill it. Morgan's demon was the angel hosted in the focus; the destruction of its host soul prompted it to claim a new soul. 

The fall of the first angel can be tied to the legacy of the touched. Among the original inspirations for this project was the nemesis, a being responsible for the war of the gods who was anihilated, thrown into exile in the rift created by his destruction. That idea did not evaporate; it was explored as a variation on the demon within thread. 

To apply some of those ideas to the current project, some minor adjustments are required. The concept of the touched is still applicable; although the demon's focus was destroyed, the mortal descendants of the exile inherited a sympathetic link to the demon. 

The idea of a protege of the magus and follower of the god who attempted to breed an avatar of the god can be realized in the father. In a sense, the father, who was himself a bit touched was being influenced to provide the exile with a suitable host. 

The critical revision concerns the nature of the exile. In the current revision, it was the demon's focus that was destroyed provoking the demon and shattering reality. As the soul expired, its ashes were scattered through the rift, the minds inhabiting it reduced to empty shells of thought. 



The founder of the second age of magic had discovered that psychic ability was the key to both magic and miracles. A prodigal student discovered that psychic ability was also the key to the rift. 

:. The avatars arc provides a significant amount of material that works with the current breakdown, but there are other elements to be incorporated as well. 

:. The demon within thread is a key part of the story and is usually established in a childhood tragedy, at which time the girl managed to eclipse the demon attempting to possess her. The specific events need to be retailored to support the current version of the story; for example, some of the integrated threads feature a strong and persistent relationship between the girl and her mother but the usual foundation of the demon within thread is the massacre of her family. 

:. What is certain is that the event happens when she is seven. When she is seventeen, she returns home and is forced to confront her childhood demons. 

:. It was always part of the initial inspiration for the boy to be a rift walker and the development of the story established a point where he and his father crossed over to a splinter of reality where he was born as a girl. 

:. An option exists for the boy and his father to have crossed over earlier; the father ending up in a triangle relationship with the native version of himself and his lover. The girl's mother was originally depicted in such a relationship. 

:. It is possible that it was the girl who crossed over with her father following the death of her mother. Her father was a rift walker, like his counterpart, and entered the rift to rescue his daughter when she fell into the rift to escape from the demon that was trying to possess her. 

:. This approach causes the girl's mother to be eclipsed and take on the role of the goddess of mystery in the unpromised thread. The girl's adversary is her mother's personal demon -- her own is currently in possession of her body. Her mother's demon seeks to seduce her into embracing the demon within her. 

In her own world, the girl and her father were the only survivors of the massacre that wiped out their entire extended family. In part, it was having nothing to return to that compelled her father not to try finding their way back home. 

:. It was always part of the girl's thread that she possessed and used her psychic potential to eclipse a demon, establishing the demon within thread. There are a number of explored options for defining the circumstances of her childhood trauma. 

In both worlds, the mother was the protege of the father's mother. Officially, the girl is an orphan and a protege of the boy's mother. Her father was presented as his counterpart's twin, at his mother's insistence -- to claim the girl as her own heir. 

:. The demon within threads for the girl and the boy have resolved into a stable form in which her ordeal triggers his. The only adjustment would be for the demon within to be a fragment of the demon of the realm, allowing her assimilation of that fragment to be a step toward assimilating the demon entirely, a credible threat -- and opportunity -- in the demon's point of view. 

:. The point of allowing the demon to take possession of the girl's body is that it allows the boy to be turned into a familiar, thus gaining the ability to assume the girl's form. The fact that being possessed allows the girl to experience life in another realm, and thus a completely different environment, is a bonus. The method used to restore her to her proper self is a method that could be used to liberate aeirn from whatever intelligence had harnessed it to exploit it as a game. Of course, looked at from the other side of the threshold, it could arguably destroy the entire world. 

:. The unpromised arc initially featured background concerning her return home, an episode involving her education and household obligations passed on from her mother, who had fled from them. Among the obligations she faces are the duties to her house and an arranged marriage. The boy to whom she has been engaged is the son of the man her mother was supposed to marry, a pact between houses that had been put off for a generation. 

:. The engagement the girl is thrust into does not need to involve her male incarnation; in fact, the engagement is a threat to her relationship with him, or more accurately, her relationship with him is seen as a threat to her engagement. The boy she is engaged to is actually a player character, as in the threshold thread. 

The girl fell in with the wrong crowd while growing up. Her amazing agility earned her an unwilling, street-wise apprenticeship in cat burglary, disguised initially as training in gymnastics, acrobatics and fighting known as shadow-dancing. She does such a good job of obscuring her life as a theif that she somehow ends up with a reputation in the underworld as an unusually competent young assassin. 

The boy the girl ends up engaged to was introduced through the game as an orphan. Her father takes him on as his protege and heir to establish his own tradition in the art. He employed the art and the skills of an assassin as a hunter of immortals, and taught them to the boy. The boy took an interest in the girl when she became caught up in the world of assassins and immortals. 

This approach also lends itself to a version of the wager, involving her in events that lead up to the ruins becoming the site for the trials, through her helping to reveal what is lurking within them. It would involve her in events that end in her death -- or possession by her demon and complete assimilation by her other half, incorporating elements of his transformation. Both of them endure a trial of transformation as she struggles with being infected with vampirism and animorphism, eclipsed by her demon, redeemed by her other half and finally merging with him. 

:. The ideas that are being tapped for this project have been in development for decades and each concept has many variations. 

:. a girl possessed and eclipsed by a demon .: this is the premise of the demon within thread in its mature form, the initial climax in the girl's story. 

The girl's childhood trauma has long been associated with the demon within thread and many approaches depend on this context. The details of her ordeal return to her as the demon strives to overcome her from within. This struggle for possession presents an opportunity for the boy to gain the girl's form by becoming a familiar -- it can also serve as a motive for immortals to cooporate to destroy her. 

.: confronts a boy bitten by the demon and turned into her twin : the problem here is that this is essentially the establishing event in the demon familiar origin of a person who is divided into male and female incarnations; in order for this boy to be the girl's counterpart, something of this nature has to have already occurred. 

.: helps the boy cope with being a girl : this was an original main thread -- a boy-turned-girl -- and can be adapted to resolve a childhood division or merge two splinter incarnations. 

:. a boy-turned-girl .: this thread has evolved as the complement of the demon within thread, exploring the boy's ordeal of gradually assimilating his female counterpart. 

.: is raped by the demon : this is the crisis point of the conflict and the opening part of the climax of the demon within thread. As a singular duality origin, this rape would result in the conception of the main character. A conception under the present circumstances would be parthenogenic. 

.: slays the demon : this is the turning point and escalation of the climax employing one of the oldest inspirations, the slain twin. When the boy-turned-girl slew the demon, its body automatically reverted to its original female form in a desperate attempt to repair itself but the demon was still impaled. 

.: is possessed and eclipsed by the demon : this is the revealed mechanism of the slain twin thread. As its host body died, the demon took possession of the only other body available, leaving the girl's corpse to be discovered. 

.: crosses the threshold : this element has been developed in several forms, each suitable for the main story line. The ordeal she goes through here is potentially a book in its own right. It can easily be developed as a sequel, however. The original demon within thread involved a struggle for dominance; the girl's possession is intermittent and the boy's transformation gives the demon a way to edge her out and force him to assimilate her. 

:. Her assimilation leaves the demon in possession of her body, until her body is slain and the demon takes possession of his body. Another benefit is that the demon within and the demon of the realm are separate entities. This demon would have originated in the mind of an eclipsed soul of the aegis and most likely would have fallen during the purge or the age of ruin. The world within this demon is still taking shape, inspired by the dreams and memories of souls native to both aeirn and the aegis. 

:. A significant amount of the avatars story arc fits directly into this design, up to and including the possession and eclipse of the main character. Even though there is an option to have the demon assimilated instantly, the experiences the main character has while eclipsed by the demon sheds light on how people from the realm of aegis gained access to the realm of aeirn. This allows most of the unpromised story arc to be resurrected, up to and including the preparation of the main character to confront the demon and face destruction. 

:. The follow-up to the unpromised arc is the threshold story arc, which is set up in the opening story. Some characters and elements of the threshold can be introduced in the first book, along with characters and elements of the accidental assassin.

:: eclipsed :: 

Once eclipsed by the demon, she found herself in limbo, lost in a nightmare wasteland that was a pale reflection of reality. 

For her, the demon's realm was at first an incredibly lucid dream and potentially an eternal prison. It takes her a while to navigate the wasteland nightmare that enveloped the world within. In that ordeal, time seemed to have no meaning, but once she surfaces in the realm, things pick up. 

The depths of the demon's mind was where the souls it collected were imprisoned, and the nightmare they shared evolved into a mortal realm. 

The seed souls initially entered a kind of wasteland, a chaotic, shifting amorphea polarized by the surreal and the ideal. Their thoughts and feelings created the world they existed in, an unending dream that was difficult to control because it was shared. 

In time, they learned how to manipulate their reality, even as reality became stable through the influence of their offspring, replicating the pattern of their host realm and becoming the inner gods of the demon’s realm. 

There, she encountered other lost souls, among them individuals who had turned their back on the lure of becoming gods of the inner realm to search for a way back to the realm of their origin.
