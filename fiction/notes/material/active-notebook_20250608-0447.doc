The process worked out in recent notes could be applied in this case with the demon, in possession of one soul, seducing another soul with dreams of godhood. Her father was seduced by a demon through her mother, a
 woman her father was passionately in love with. The demon exploited their love to lure the man into the fusion. The demon had no soul of its own. It simply served as the catalyst in destruction of two souls and the template for the creation of a god--and
 a god-child. The spirits of the complimentary souls were harvested and recombined to create one "perfect" soul and one "pure" soul. Thus emerged a god impregnated by its own creation. In the weaker version, a third soul in the mix significantly changes
 things.

Morgan from a girl into a boy, as a part of resurrecting the ring bearer and being reincarnated by him as a son. In this variant, the interaction between the male and female incarnations of Morgan occurs in dreams that serve as the girl's reawakening. A s
u
b-variant features the male and female incarnations of Morgan meeting in a world within the demon as a consequence of the demon's attempt to take possession of the boy's body. This thread holds a great deal of potential, allowing this particular chapter o

\par The same idea can be employed with the sex of each incarnation inverted, with the girl confronting her former self in the shadow of possession. The demon would have reincarnated her in ord
er to use her to escape from the ring. The same situations and scenarios could be played out in the real world in a singular duality split in the same generation. In a staggered division of Morgan, the story benefits from its focus on an individual. If th
o
se incarnations are looped so that their lives overlap, there are some benefits from their interaction but they could be achieved with less strain by having Morgan divided in another fashion. Establishing a cause for Morgan's division presents a challenge
, usually resolved by an unusual conception or demonic intervention during childhood.

\par Three stories, possibly short stories, explore the events that lead to the conception of Dusk and Dawn and their initiation under Ash and Ember. 
\par 
\par 
\par Episode One
\par 
\par Ash and Ember became fused together as a result of pooling their resources as an artist and a muse in battle. Their union gave rise to a new consciousness; an androgynous being that could become either male or female. A child who e
clipsed her own parents, Cinder was born fully formed. She was immediately confronted by the demon that had been sent to destroy her parents. When she emerged victorious, she was mistaken for a demon by her parents' allies. Unable to explain who or what s
h
e was, the feelings she had inherited from her parents compelled her to flee rather than fight. In an attempt to avoid capture, Cinder stumbled upon her ability to assume female form. Her transformation gave her captors pause, and at their prompting, she 
d
iscovered that she could also assume male form and adopted the alias, Coal, for that form. Once her captors fully examined her, confirming her origins in Ash and Ember and recognizing her as a unique entity, they named her a child of extraordinary circums
tances.

\par Episode Two
\par 
\par A
sh and Ember were both seventeen years old at the time they became fused. In theory, it was possible for them to be restored to their former selves, but the process would have killed Cinder. It took a year to discover a way to free Ash and Ember without k
i
lling Cinder. A new incarnation of Cinder could be conceived parthenogenically. After a year, Cinder had mastered the techniques necessary to produce an heir, but she found it impossible to choose between being reborn as a boy or a girl. Her natural form 
w
as sexless, making it impossible to reproduce herself in that form. She preferred to be female, but she could not give up the freedoms and opportunities that came with being male. An unexpected solution to her dilemma came three months later when Coal was
 
seduced and unintentionally sired a male heir. A reflex caused Cinder to transform and conceive a female heir. The two children, Dusk and Dawn, were both reincarnations of Cinder, but Cinder was forced to wait until they were older before she could pass o
n.
\par 
\par 
\par Episode Three
\par 
\par Ash and Ember were released a little earlier than intended, when the demon Cinder thought she had slain attempted to use her to resurrect itself. Dawn was abducted and used as bait to lure Cinder into a trap. The trap was a ritual in whi
ch the demon's cult intended to use Cinder as a sacrifice. Cinder realized that the cultists did not understand that her death would release Ash and Ember, leaving nothing for the demon to take possession of. Cinder assumed that the bond between herself a
n
d her children would serve to snatch her soul out of the demon's grasp as well. These assumptions compelled Cinder to submit to the ritual and her premature death did free Ash and Ember, who emerged untouched by time. Unfortunately, Cinder and the demon w
ere torn between Dusk and Dawn, absorbed into the depths of the children's minds. Ash and Ember, still seventeen, became the mentors and guardians of Dusk and Dawn, now seven. Dusk and Dawn were introduced to each other as initiates. 
\par 
\par 
\par Sequential
\par 
\par [3] Approach
es that "divide" Morgan into sequential incarnations through transformation by the demonic ring have often been troubled by uncertainty over the order in which Morgan is born male and female. In particular, when Morgan has been born male initially, there 
h
as been difficulty with determining the cause and significance of Morgan's transformation. When born male, there is a strong tendency to make Morgan transgendered so that his transformation into a girl is a welcome, if difficult and disconcerting ordeal. 
T
hat approach allows Morgan to be at peace with herself, and is in keeping with the idea of self-assertion. When Morgan is reincarnated as a boy, having him revert to being a girl seems to send the opposite message, reinforcing the general belief that "who
 
you are is a consequence of what you are". The boy-first approach has been difficult for me to employ because of my own transgender experiences. In essence, Morgan was created to embody my true self and I hate to compromise her girlhood. However, the enti
r
e purpose of having her live a life as a boy is to give her the benefit of what I have experienced. In clarifying the ethereal elements of human incarnation, in which a soul is born of random opportunity, neither invited nor impressed into being, that con
cern has been diminished. 
\par 
\par Using the randomness of human incarnation, Morgan can be born from my own circumstances, driven to question his true nature by feelings of misconception. The difference in Morgan's life will be that circumstances conspired to enc
ourage his exploration of femininity in a limited and critical fashion, while otherwise presenting him with the same expectations of manhood that plague the transgendered. Like myself, Morgan is an orphan of circumstance, an unwanted child his mother was 
f
orce to give up and whom his father rejected. His mother was a muse, the most independent of women at the cost of marriage and family, and his father was a paladin. Neither parent could afford to acknowledge Morgan, though Morgan's mother fought against t
h
e inevitable, ultimately surrendering her son when forced to choose between being a muse or raising an apparent bastard as an unwed mother in poverty. Where I was delivered to a new family eventually, Morgan was sent to an orphanage. From there the origin
al path of seduction into the life of a child thief unravels, with one notable twist. 
\par 
\par Prior to being orphaned, Morgan lived at the center of an independent woman's world, surrounded by female role models, but knowing men only in passing. He knew men as vi
sitors and viewed them as competition for his mother's attention, rarely interacted with boys (a cousin or two, children of his mother's acquaintances or siblings) and was often left in the care of maidens or in the company of girls. On occasion, he had l
i
mited interaction with his father. At the orphanage, Morgan experienced gender bias for the first time, and was constantly being reprimanded for exhibiting feminine behavior, though he was quick to adapt and adopt masculine habits and attitudes. The best 
w
ay to envision Morgan is as a tomboy in a boy's body. A slight, slender and beautiful boy, it was not hard for Morgan to pass for a girl, and constantly being mistaken for a girl was a hallmark of his childhood (and part of what allowed his mother to keep
 him as long as she did). Because of feelings of persecution, Morgan escaped from the orphanage whenever he could, befriending street orphans and getting caught up in the exploitive games that dragged children into the underworld. 
\par 
\par As a child, Morgan prove
d to be very agile and intelligent. He was introduced to cat burglary through games of exploration and hide and seek in the homes and warehouses of the well to do. It was a general progression from the abandoned buildings in which the orphans made their h
o
mes, to the invasion of other peoples' homes. At first, younger children like Morgan were just playing, while the older kids did the stealing. Pick pocketing was taught as sleight of hand, breaking and entering as feats of acrobatic daring-do, and Morgan 
w
as always eager to prove his dexterity and agility. Morgan was tricked into stealing the first few times. Having a bed at the orphanage meant that Morgan usually did not need to steal in order to survive. When out and about, Morgan could usually earn enou
gh to survive doing street acrobatics or singing, often because he was mistaken for a beautiful girl. It was longing for the past that prompted Morgan to fixate on feminine close and artifacts, when exploring the homes of the wealthy. 
\par 
\par Although Morgan was 
under constant pressure to live up to his manhood, and for the most part determined to be a good boy, the occasional remark or case of being mistaken for a girl were constant reminders of his origins and unstated assumption that he was a girl. Morgan like
d
 being beautiful and agile, tended to think of himself as a cat in spirit (and in many ways was, a trait that would repeatedly get him into trouble), and in some ways welcomed it when called a girl in insult. As a boy, he was subject to endless torment an
d
 abuse, it seemed, and being called a girl was supposed to be the worst insult, but as a girl, when mistaken for one, Morgan was treated well and almost universally liked. It was initially curiosity, inspired by that observation, that compelled Morgan to 
d
eliberately pose as a girl. Morgan's initial thefts went unnoticed by his peers mostly because it was an experiment conducted in secret, causing the first major break from that group of friends. The experiment was, however, a success. When presented with 
a less androgynous, or less ambiguous, "girl" the reaction most people had to Morgan was positive. 
\par 
\par Of course, this was a tiny outlet. Morgan could not always pose as a girl. It was just that, when posing as a girl, Morgan was most happy and free. Ironical
ly, it was betting caught in the act that changed Morgan's life most dramatically. A patron of the arts and theater had taken note of the "girl" singing and dancing in the streets for change that later recognized Morgan in the guise of a boy on a differen
t
 occasion, who offered Morgan a new life. While women had certain rights and privileges under certain circumstances, they were banned from acting in the theater. Women's and girl's roles were played by boys and Morgan was obviously a natural talent at tha
t
 sort of thing. The man learned that Morgan was an inmate of the orphanage and made arrangements to become Morgan's patron and guardian in order to bring Morgan into the theater. With this employment came a better education, more pleasant accommodations, 
and open encouragement for acting like a girl. Morgan was an instant success, though of course initially in minor roles. Unfortunately, being openly known for acting like a girl, Morgan was only treated like a girl on stage. 
\par 
\par On the street, Morgan's profes
sion only made it harder to be accepted as a boy, and his popularity made it impossible to avoid recognition, which made it virtually impossible for him to be mistaken for a girl on the street. His patron insisted that he learn how to fight and fence to d
e
fend himself from the contempt and envy of his peers. Morgan had been pushed into true cat burglary before he was discovered, and his mentors in crime used their knowledge of his criminal exploits to gain leverage over him. Only rarely was Morgan forced t
o
 return to cat burglary, instead, the leverage was used to exploit Morgan him--or rather "her"--self. Morgan never saw any of the "profits" of indulging the curiosity and desires of the men he was forced to submit to. Morgan was treated as an equal only b
y
 his closest peers, other female impersonators. His prospects for the future were revealed to him through his friends as well. As puberty hit, the girls of stage had to either transition successfully into male roles, sacrifice their manhood altogether, or
 retire from theater altogether. 
\par 
\par From the day Morgan confronted the ultimate outcome of puberty, emasculation had been a dark temptation held at bay only by a genuine longing to have children and a family. Fortunately, Morgan was one of those rare boys wh
o remained androgynous through puberty, and was gifted with an astonishing increase in vocal range, never losing his upper range but gaining a deeper one. Still a pretty boy, Morgan made a beautiful woman on stage, and enjoyed an undisputed claim on the l
e
ad female roles. With the fame and the thrill of absolute freedom on stage came a certain notoriety and unwanted patronage. More than once, Morgan's manhood was threatened by an "admirer's" attempt to ensure "her" future. Even more disturbing, Morgan's be
s
t friend had become a handsome young man and successfully transitioned into the lead male roles opposite her. Their friendship was built on a strong foundation of shared experiences, but in those moments on stage when Morgan was truly "herself" he had fal
len in love with her friend. Having him come to his rescue when an unwanted lover was bent on emasculating Morgan only made things worse. 
\par 
\par The one thing that had prevented her co-star from falling in love with Morgan was his discovery of "her" liaisons. Si
nce he never confronted Morgan about it, he did not know that "she" was being blackmailed into it until the night he saved Morgan from emasculation. After an emotional confrontation, as concern, relief, frustration, betrayal and blackmail had all been arg
u
ed through, he retreated to reconsider his feelings for Morgan, leaving Morgan confused and afraid. When word of the incident reached Morgan's patron, Morgan was finally confronted with the matter of "her" career. Being a girl was what Morgan excelled at,
 
and he had a promising future ahead of him. Unfortunately, time would eventually catch up to him, taking away the voice, face and body that Morgan's career depended on. It would be years before it happened, but if it was to be prevented, something had to 
b
e done soon. Others had chosen to sow their seeds wherever possible and then make the sacrifice that would guarantee them a future in the theater. It was generally assumed that Morgan would make the same sacrifice, but alone in the dark hours of the night
, Morgan fought it. 
\par 
\par Unable to imagine giving up the female roles, even for a male lead, Morgan made a quiet commitment to the knife, hoping the accepted practice of scattering seeds to the wind would ease the pain of sacrificing any hopes of having a fami
ly. Perversely, the only liaisons Morgan had entered willingly had been with women fascinated with Morgan's pose. Finding willing mothers for his children proved to be no challenge, but the prospect remained daunting. Morgan became distant and spent hours
 wandering lost in thought, wrestling his thoughts and feelings. 
\par 
\par An Elegant Overlap
\par 
\par For use with current notes: The revision in progress features a male first incarnation overlapped by a female second incarnation. The pair are orphans of circumstance. As
h's story has been revised up to the point of resolving the events that result in his transformation into a girl. Ember's story can be assembled from the body of notes already on hand. Changes in her story include her abduction by the demon who sired her 
a
s a reincarnation of Ash. The demon was compelled to fulfill a paradox it had engineered to escape from its prison. The demon sent her back in time twenty years, where she was adopted by a were-tiger. Her guardian, Logan, was also Ash's dance and fencing 
i
nstructor and an ally of the boy's patron, a vampire lord named Roark. Through these associations, Ash and Ember became pseudo siblings. As a result, Ash and Ember play a part in each other's stories. The paradox they are intimately caught up in originate
s with the demon, when Roark and Logan joined forces against the hunter who bound the demon. 
\par 
\par The demon was once an angel of the goddess, and loved her unconditionally. In time, the angel realized that it was an extension of its creator, having neither a s
oul of its own nor the capacity to become her equal. In a foolish bid to rectify this problem, seeking a soul of its own, the angel tried to take possession of a human soul unwittingly turning itself into a demon. Changed in a fundamental way, and rebuked
 
by the goddess, the demon clung to its quest for godhood, clinging to the memory of an unrequited love. Unfortunately, there were only two ways to attain godhood, allow itself to be devoured and assimilated by its host soul or transfer itself to a willing
 soul, a soul willing to be devoured and resurrected in the demon's image. (In part, Ash inherits some of the demon's traits when turned into a girl, "becoming" Ember's twin--or rather, her template.)
\par 
\par The first was unthinkable, and the second was unlikely, particularly since the descendants of the man it had possessed persisted in hunting the demon through the generations. Eventually, one of the hunters succeeds
 in trapping the demon, using his own soul as bait. The trap was a ring that appeared completely h
armless, but the instant the demon took possession of the hunter the ring's enchantment was activated, entrapping the demon and binding it. In the process, the hunter's soul was also trapped, but the ring gave him mastery over the demon and all of its pow
ers. The hunter embraced his stolen immortality and bent the demon to his will as he set out to rid the world of other preternatural threats. This hunter eventually came to Ruins' Deep, slaying those closest to Logan and Roark, and raising their wrath.  

\par 
\par W
hen the demon's master was brought down by the bites of the immortals, the demon asked him to set it free. Believing that the demon would act to preserve him, the hunter submitted to possession. In the time between that, and the destruction of its master'
s
 body, the demon wove a spell it had been working on for the length of its enslavement. That spell was designed to call a willing soul to retrieve the ring, set the demon free and surrender itself to the demon's design. Ash, secretly longing for transform
a
tion, qualified and the spell shaped events to guide him to it. What the demon did not know was that its objective had been attained. The hunter had assumed that the demon was suggesting their apotheosis, planning to save them both by attaining godhood. I
nstead, the demon allowed the hunter's destruction to punish him for entrapping it, seizing the opportunity to execute its plan at the same time. 
\par 
\par Ember was a key part of the spell, the catalyst that it used to lure Ash into its web, the demon's cat's paw 
for the period of time in which it could not act directly. Ash could not help but be drawn to Ember, the embodiment of his desire. They met at a swimming hole, and became friends. They became involved with the street gangs together, Ember posing as a boy.
 
Ember brought Ash along to a party, for which Ash was required to pose as a girl. This was a pattern that repeated, her posing as a boy to mingle in the streets, him posing as a girl to venture into the homes of her friends. When the pair were caught in t
he act, it prompted Ash's introduction into the theater and earned him the vampire's patronage. Having an outlet for his feminine impulses eases the pain of being transgendered, allowing Ash to cope with being male. 
\par 
\par Ember presented him with a unique probl
em. As the girl he dreamed of being, she was inadvertently the girl of his dreams. Thought his desire was to be her, his body transformed that into a desire for her. Given the age at which they became acquainted, it had the effect of making him rather uni
que among boys as far as she was concerned. 
\par 
\par Sufficient notes to detail their lives are already available and only need to be put into context. Ember played an innocent role in putting Ash at risk of emasculation. As Ash became known for portraying a girl 
on stage, it became less common for him to pass for a girl in public, but his fame was not absolute. On occasion, he was put in a position where he had to go out in character to parties or special events and there were always those who were ignorant and t
h
ose who were in the know, so it was not uncommon for him to find himself in awkward situations with a private, amused audience. Ember often accompanied him, unwittingly adding to the deception by treating Ash as a girl whenever he presented as one. On one
 
occasion, a young man who became enraptured by Ash responded to discovering the truth by ambushing him with a group of friends. On another occasion, the brothers and father of a girl who seduced him--after one of the brothers confirmed the truth, having b
een enticed by his sister's claim that Ash was "fixed"--cornered him at a party and would have emasculated him if the sister had not brought Ash's friends to the rescue. 
\par 
\par The closing end of the loop deals with the theft of the ring. The ring and it's forme
r master has a certain fame in certain circles, and word eventually got out what had happened to the hunter and his ring. An item of such power interested a number of parties, who were leery of challenging the immortals who destroyed its former master. An
 
individual determined to acquire the ring identified Ash and Ember as the perfect pawns in his scheme. With a little investigation, he found those who had leverage over Ash and learned of his devotion to Ember. Things got out of hand when the ring transfo
r
med Ash. In the process, it literally became attached to him, and made it impossible to complete the task he had been given. Between them, Ash and Ember, now two girls, tried to find a solution, but the did not succeed in time. The theft was discovered an
d Logan set out to find the ring. Initially unable to find anything to identify the thief, it took him a while to reach the only plausible conclusion. 
\par 
\par Logan set out in search of Ash. Losing his trail and finding only Ember's trail--it seemed--he followed 
her. By chance, he followed the girl Ash had become, but mistook her for his ward. The confrontation turned into a fight and she took flight. This perceived rebellion prompted Logan to punish his wayward cub. Ash had never known that Ember had been born a
 
were-tiger, though he had seen her and her guardian in tiger form many times. Nor had he known that his patron was a vampire. His shock at the discovery prompted his confession. On their return, Ash and Logan learned of Ember's brutal assassination, a war
n
ing from the man who contracted the theft of the ring. Her death, the theft of the ring, and their fear of the demon's resurrection combined to condemn Ash. Bound to the ring, she was essentially immortal, but between them Roark and Logan had the power to
 destroy her. 
\par 
\par Ash was consumed by the conflicting nature of the immortals' bites. Unlike the hunter, however, Ash welcomed her destruction, consumed by grief for Ember. Instead of fighting, Ash willed the infections on, unwittingly embracing the spiritual
 transformation. In Ash, the two antagonistic designs found a common thread, the power of regeneration Ash had gained from the demon during her fight with Logan. Instead of being destroyed, Ash was somehow perfected, turning into a were-vampire and fallin
g
 into a deathlike repose. Elsewhere, Ember was rising from a similar deathlike state, slipping away from the morgue where she had been subjected to autopsy and embalming before being left alone long enough for her body to repair itself. Fortunately for he
r, Ember retained no memory of feeding to fuel her recovery. At least not consciously. Those nightmares would visit her later. 
\par 
\par Returning home to find Ash dead drove her into a rage. Assuming that Ash had suffered the same fate she had, she set out in sear
ch of the man who had killed her. Ash, of course, was not quite dead. The ordeal had been very traumatic, however, and she was in no state to object when the god took possession of her body. To do so, it gathered her soul and sealed it in a mote of flesh,
 a seed that would lie dormant in her own womb for two years. 
\par 
\par Although there is a temptation to have Ember's nature remain latent until her death, old notes based on Avonlea give a basis for her to be born an immortal. In addition, it is her nature that c
auses her to be adopted by Logan and Roark. Initially, her tiger nature masks and suppresses her vampire nature, at least to her. Logan and Roark were aware of her dual nature, and attributed it to an unlikely mating between a were-tiger mother and a vamp
i
re father. This is the explanation that Ember is given when her patrons catch up to her. Only a were could supply enough blood to permit a vampire to live, a fact proven by Logan and Roark. Once a vampire attained a living state, he could sustain it in th
e
 normal fashion, but a mortal wound would cause it to revert to it's undead state. A living vampire could and often did sire children if the opportunity arose. The thing that made a successful mating between a vampire and a were so improbable was the diff
iculty vampire and were females had carrying children to term. It had happened at least once that Roark knew of, a long time ago. Ember was only the second he knew of. 
\par 
\par A Chance Encounter
\par 
\par In a passing conversation with a stranger in a tavern, who turned o
ut to be a wizard, Morgan struggled to convey his problem to the befuddled man. He shocked Morgan by asking him why he simply did not have himself transformed into a woman. Morgan could not believe such a thing was possible, and the wizard assured him tha
t
, though it was rare, it was well within the bounds of magic. Morgan pointed out that being transformed into a woman would end his career instantly. The wizard shrugged that off, observing that the reason Morgan was devoted to the stage was because it was
 
the only place he could be himself. Morgan could not refute it. The wizard gave Morgan a ring, explaining how it worked and advising him to use it to reach a decision about the future. Morgan was given a reasonable period of time in which to conduct the e
xperiment, at the end of which he would be stuck with whatever form he was in when he returned the ring. 
\par 
\par A Chance Encounter Revised
\par 
\par In keeping with the idea of Morgan finding the ring and or tangling with a demon, a new idea popped up. Initially, the tho
ught was for Morgan to encounter a demon on the run from demon hunters. Mistaking the androgynous creature for a boy like himself, he intervened and rescued the demon. To repay Morgan, and in part to acquiesce to Morgan's plea that the demon surrender the
 
soul it had possessed, the demon transforms Morgan into a girl--transferring itself to Morgan via the ring its victim had donned. This was simplified to Morgan being tasked by his mentors in crime to steal an artifact from his patron. His patron is of cou
rse a vampire lord and the ring the prison of a demon. To reward Morgan for "rescuing" it, the demon gives Morgan the power to change into a girl, gaining a foothold on Morgan's soul in the process. 
\par 
\par While considering this revision, an option to loop Morga
n's future incarnation was brought to mind, initially having the girl arrive in the past in the place of the demon-in-distress. Instead, the idea of having her arrival coincide with the boy's displacement from his home cropped up. 
\par 
\par Morgan's mother had bee
n a maiden of the goddess when he was conceived. Bearing a child was a necessary step to becoming a muse, as her patronage dictated, and normally by the will of the goddess her child should have been a daughter who would in turn be raised as a maiden of t
h
e goddess. The man Moira chose, however, was a paladin of the god, who, by the will of the god, could only bear a son. (Whoops, we're back to a two-blessings-equals-a-curse... okay, run with it. The child is born ambisexually polymorphic and divided into 
male and female by a demon that is undone in the process. 
\par 
\par AN: A new incarnation of the same soul. In pursuit of one idea, another emerged. In this instance, the overlap of staggered incarnations might be essential. It does depend on separate incarnations 
drawn into a fusion. The demon could have its origins in the character, or remain an external device. 
\par 
\par A boy driven to manifest his true self. A deal with a demon. A girl reborn. An angel with a debt to pay. A formula for apotheosis. He was born of random
 chance, an androgynous and unwanted boy. In the wake of much soul searching, he comes to realize that the girl of his dreams is the girl he dreams of being. In his pursuit of a way to transform himself, he devotes himself to the study of magic. In the co
urse of events he comes to the rescue of a girl who embodies his self image, then discovers it is in fact a demon. 
[1] The demon is indifferent to the boy's moral qualms, attaching itself to him in order to repay the boy for rescuing him. The boy asks the de
mon to free the soul it possessed, and it points out that it would not grant a wish that invalidated its debt. In short order, the demon discovers the boy's secret desire and reveals that it could grant the boy's wishes--the spoken and unspoken ones--with
 
a minor price. The demon tells the boy to surrender his soul to it, explaining that it would allow the demon to surrender the soul it possessed, transform the boy into a girl, and transform the demon into a guardian angel. Instead of the demon possessing 
the boy, the boy could be a girl and possess an angel. It took a lot of soul searching and agonizing, but ultimately the temptation was too great to refuse, especially when he could justify it with the knowledge that the demon's host would be freed. 

\par 
\par The t
ransformation occurred the instant she committed herself, and the meaning of possessing an angel gradually became clear. The angel resided in her mind, part of her and yet apart from her, like a separate personality. It was a ghost only she could perceive
,
 an invisible friend. It proved to be an invaluable companion, advising, criticizing, comforting, whatever was needed. Since its survival was dependant on her survival, it did what it could to keep her sane, healthy, alive and motivated, without forcing a
n
ything on her. Technically, it could not force her, since it could only function in accordance with her will. The powers a demon or angel had were drawn from the soul it was bound to, so the angel served as a way for her to tap into her own potential, phy
sical, mental and spiritual. As it was her soul, and the spirit she embraced was true to her self, it was more appropriate to say that she had become an angel. Of course, she was her own authority, not the servant of a god. 
\par 
\par Being a girl "touched by an ang
el" did not solve all of her problems, and created some new ones. For one thing, she had no past, no foundation to build her future on. Still, she was young and eager for adventure. Having been raised as a boy, she was well equipped to become a maiden, th
e
 female equivalent of a knight. She had to work twice as hard to prove herself, but she was deliriously happy until she fell into the hands of feuding immortals. There were certain benefits to hosting an angel, but not when it came to dealing with immorta
l
s. As far as they were concerned, she was a rogue paladin, and that made her a threat to them. Her adventures are the meat of the story, but she falls to the destructive combination of a vampire and a were-tiger's bites. She survives, by virtue of her gua
rdian angel, but does not adapt well to her transformation. Immortality had already been hers, as part of her pact with the angel. What she had become frightened her, threatening to strip away her humanity. 
\par 
\par The path she had chosen in her new life, living 
by the sword, had carried with it the implication that she was willing to kill in order to survive. As a were-vampire, killing to survive was a more immediate prospect, however. The hunger and thirst that came with her transformation were powerful instinc
t
s that she could barely control. To channel those instincts toward animal prey required her to surrender her humanity, hunting and feeding as an animal. If she fought to remain human, then she found herself drawn to human prey--and enjoying it. When her p
a
ssions as a woman and a predator resulted in the death of a lover, she could not forgive herself. She ignored her guardian angel and walked out to meet the dawn, choosing to end her life rather than risk allowing it to happen again. The angel fought her w
ill, refusing to let her die, for thought the girl thought she deserved to die, there was still one thing she had longed for desperately. Her only regret, upon becoming a girl, was that she had not been born and grown up a girl. 
\par 
\par Fulfilling that wish was o
ne way the angel could ensure their mutual survival. The angel was able to preserve a single mote of the girl's body, purified in the fire of her atonement. It was within the angel's power to turn that cinder into an ember of new life, but it no longer ha
d
 access to a body capable of bearing a child. At least, not at that moment, the angel realized. The only way to see if it was within the girl's potential was by calling upon it. Only as a body manifested around the ember did the angel think to consider wh
ere the winds had carried it. The poor girl was dragged naked from her bed and thrust into the cold night air a stone's throw over the edge of a sea cliff.  
\par 
\par AN: This time-loop does not overlap and as developed at this point does not present an opportunity
 for the two incarnations to interact. In many respects, the second incarnation is superfluous. The original intent of the refining fire was to establish the phoenix aspect of the character. Still, the ideas in play are interesting. 
\par 
\par [1] Confronting the b
oy with the embodiment of his true self is an alternative to confronting a rogue demon. The looping of incarnations always provides this opportunity, and she often becomes the catalyst in the boy's transformation, encouraging his soul-searching misadventu
res, experiencing a psychic fusion in a moment of intimacy out of which a demon emerges in possession of the boy's body. Her presence in his life is highly beneficial to the story. 
\par 
\par A New Approach
\par 
\par A different cause of division can be achieved through a sl
ight variation of the girl's childhood trauma. The device most commonly used to transform the girl into a boy is a demon, or rather the unique characteristics or powers of a demon, harnessed by an enchanted ring. As the nature of demons and angels has bee
n
 studied, a different consequence of the original and long held notion of the girl overcoming a demon's attempt to possess her came to light. A natural psychic, when Morgan was used as a demonic sacrifice, she fought the enslavement of her soul and in the
 
process became divided into male and female halves. The male Morgan was created as a result of being the latent aspect of the girl the demon was able to assimilate before Morgan turned the tide. In essence, as Morgan's spirit was being torn apart and rewo
v
en, Morgan's psyche was split between two perspectives, each coherent enough to instinctively fight for survival against the force tearing Morgan apart. Thus, a spirit half destroyed and a spirit half created turned on the spirit that was responsible, and
 found in it the key to repairing themselves, destroying the demon by each assimilating half of it. In ethereal terms, Morgan became a god, manifest as a boy and a girl. 
\par 
\par Individually, the boy and girl were virtually human. Each had gained incredible power
s of regeneration, though Morgan's psychic abilities were partially crippled, limited to minor telepathic and telekinetic abilities and cursed with psychic hypersensitivity to magic. They also inherited certain negative traits from the demon, a cold calcu
l
ating lethality neither suspected, a degree of amorality, and a devastating, latent psychic ability to disrupt flesh or spirit. The boy was the first to recover from the trauma of their ordeal, and carried the girl to safety. The local priests and healers
 
quickly deduced part of what happened when the boy identified himself as Morgan, informing the girl's parents that they had gained a son, and advising them to keep the two children separate for a few years and instructing them not to inform the children o
f
 their true relation to each other. Since the children could not remember what had happened to them, and could barely remember anything from before the ordeal, the full story remained unknown. In their fight for survival, the pair had slaughtered the men 
who had abducted and sacrificed Morgan, and both relived the trauma in nightmares for years to come. This trait would help bring them together when they reencountered each other as adolescents eight years later. 
\par 
\par From the age of seven to fifteen, Morgan Du
sk and Morgan Dawn were raised separately by their father and mother respectively. Due to other circumstances, Moira and Logan had not been forced to conceal their love and could not marry, so the children grew up ignorant of their true parentage, in addi
t
ion to being kept ignorant of the truth about each other. Their memories of their brief time together before being separated faded with time. At the age of fourteen, Dusk and Dawn each came to the city of Avon to complete their training and education at t
h
e academy. During their first year, they barely crossed paths, taking an initial dislike to each other due to the taunting "match making" of their peers, and embarrassment over sharing the same name. In the summer, as they both turned fifteen, they encoun
t
ered each other at a secret swimming hole, and stubbornly refused to let the other's presence drive them off. Gradually thawing to each other's presence, they eventually began to talk and share interests, quickly becoming intimate. The physical chemistry 
b
etween them was overwhelming, compelling and frightening at the same time. Their friendship grew, strained by awkward, intimate moments. The intensity of their mutual attraction disturbed and confused them, complicating their relationships with each other
 and the people they were drawn to emotionally. 
\par 
\par The might have become an inseparable couple, if not for the fact that their first glorious day together ended with a terrible revelation. Caught together by their parents, a chance meeting in public followin
g one of the rare liaisons between Logan and Moira, the two were taken aside and informed that they were siblings--twins to be precise. Forced to deny their intimacy and sworn to keep their relationship a secret, the pair were mortified by the revelation.
 
They struck up relationships with other people, determined to give each other up. In spite of everything, they continued to have intimate encounters, driven by an almost insatiable need. Keeping their affair a secret only heightened the intimacy. In priva
t
e, they shared everything, while in public they were virtual strangers, struggling to keep their impulses from betraying them. To endure their forced separation, they remained in almost constant rapport, sharing their thoughts and feelings, and even their
 
intimate moments with their "suitable" lovers. Unfortunately, their time together at the academy was limited, and eventually it ran out. As classes concluded, they lingered in the city, delaying their final parting until their seventeenth birthday, when D
awn learned of her engagement to Dusk's best friend. 
\par 
\par In the heat of their final, farewell embrace, their longing and desperation reached its peak and the division that had torn Morgan in two was finally undone. The ecstatic fusion was overwhelming, and re
sulted in Dawn's arrest on suspicion of foul play. Dusk's father had pushed his son to enlist in the army and Dusk's failure to report to his barracks was swiftly investigated. He was tracked to the inn where he had met Dawn, and witnesses identified her 
a
s the last person Dusk was seen with. Because of the stress and anxiety of their coming separation, Dusk and Dawn had been careless and allowed themselves to be seen arguing fiercely and behaving oddly around each other. Disoriented and confused by their 
f
usion, Morgan only increased suspicion by refusing to answer questions and talking to herself. Her disturbed behavior was not enough to convict her of any wrong doing, however, though at one point the investigators threatened to have her mind probed. Morg
a
n asked for one of her instructors to be called to examine her memory, hoping that her trusted mentor would be able to explain to her what had happened the night in question. Although stunned by what he learned, the instructor was able to contain his shoc
k and inform the inquisitors that as far as Dawn remembered, Dusk had been fine when she went to bed, and had been gone without explanation when she awoke. 
\par 
\par Things became more complicated when Morgan was released and her instructor took her to see her moth
er. Not surprisingly, her father was there as well, and they demanded an explanation. Morgan could not deny the affair, nor could she explain what she experienced at its conclusion. Only then, after hearing the confirmation of Morgan's story from her ment
o
r, did Moira and Logan tell her the truth about her child hood trauma. They could not explain why the male version of Morgan was created, or who was responsible, because not even Morgan had remembered what happened to her--or him--clearly. While alone in 
p
rison, Morgan had already had the time to come to terms with the longing that had tormented her male half. To refute Dawn's fear that she had somehow absorbed her lover, Dusk had reminded her of the feelings he had of wanting to be in her, to be utterly a
n
d completely within her, of inexplicably wanting to be her, whenever they were apart. Finally, that need was explained. But, it was an answer that begged the question. Why had he been created in the first place? Could she even be a normal girl now that he
 was a part of her?
\par To complicate these questions, the matter of her engagement and impending marriage remained looming over her head. Because of the arrest and inquisition, Dusk and Dawn's affair had been publicly exposed, although fortunately not as an in
cestuous scandal. Dawn's engagement was presumed to be the cause of Dusk's disappearance.

Spirit, and things of the spirit, are the byproduct of psychic activity, forged from thought and feeling. The spirit of an animal or person is the psychic construct t
hat entity produced to define itself as it grew and evolved. The spirit of a race or species is an external creation, accreted from the psychic residue of "like-minded" souls. A racial spirit is often aspected, able to devolve into archetypes, from the ve
r
y general to the very specific. Individuals of a race often draw upon the racial spirit, adopting an archetype unconsciously and developing with a predisposition for archetypal characteristics. Demons and angels are derived from archetypes, they are spiri
t
ual constructs that are invested with a soul to drive or power them. The technical distinction between demons and angels is that a soul is typically forced into service as a demon, often stripped from a living sacrifice, while angels are created from a wi
l
ling soul, and usually the soul of their creator. There is no limit to the number of angels, and in some cases demons, that can be created from a single soul, nor is there a limit to the number of souls that can be bound to a single demon, or in some case
s
 an angel. Angels and demons are the machines of the gods, who are often souls who assimilated angelic or demonic engines. Most individuals are not conscious of their ability to perceive, create or manipulate spiritual constructs; the ones who can are psy
chics. Some are able to exploit the spiritual architecture and artifacts to perform magic in spite of latent or limited psychic ability.

\par A Tale of Transitions
\par 
\par The story of the girl has been evolving for twenty years, generally focused on the character of Avonlea. 
\par She is the daughter of a woman who appeared out of nowhere, who was pursued and claimed by three different men. 
\par She was raised as a potential paladin, the chosen of a mysterious goddess. 
\par 
\par The story of the boy has been obscured, generally based on my own life. 
\par He was the son of a man who was a knight in times of war and a bard in times of peace. 
\par He was raised as a performer, cast in female roles because of the looks he inherited from his mother. 
\par 
\par What is fairly certain: The main character was the child of a knight and a maiden of the goddess. 
\par The main character was conceived during a moment of weakness as the knight escorted the maiden to his lord. 
\par The main character's parents were caught up in a war, and a conspiracy to destroy the goddess. 
\par 
\par What has developed: There was a woman chosen by the goddess to serve as her ava
tar but the enemies of the goddess identified her and sent assassins to destroy her. Others, intent upon conquest, sought to achieve it by claiming her, and a knight was sent to capture and deliver her to his prince. Forced to defend her from assassins, a

\par AN: The questions that have held things up are concerned with the necessity of a temporal overlap vs sequential incarnations, the necessity of a singular duality requiring male and female incarnations and how best to resolve the situ
ations in each case. The simplest approaches are already well defined, and were set aside because they do not encompass a number of ideas that confront the incarnations with each other. 
\par 
\par The cause of a temporal overlap was initially tied in an action of t
he main character, but usually required the two incarnations to be sequential and overlap for as little as a month but almost never more than a decade. The first required one of the incarnations to be an orphan or an outcast, and usually the orphan was th
e boy arriving in the past at the age of seven to overlap the girl while the outcast was the girl arriving in the past at the age of seventeen to overlap the boy. Either one is a workable scenario, but both place the cause after the effect--or worse. 

\par 
\par What is the inherent truth in the story?
\par 
\par From the beginning, the impulse to have a character embodied as both sexes has been an attempt to realize the whole of human potential. In the course of normal events, that does not happen. The closest reality comes is
 people who are one sex but encompass traits of the other sex, in the extreme trying to change their sex as much as possible, but never doing so in truth. 
\par 
\par What is ultimately happening?
\par 
\par The solution to that would be to have the overlap occur as the resul
t of a prevailing event. The best option would be based on the destruction of the paladin of the ring. A maiden of the goddess is abducted by enemies of the paladin, two immortals. The maiden will eventually be the mother of Ember. Of course, the whole th
i
ng is just a trap to destroy the paladin, and to that extent it is successful. Upon the destruction of his body, the paladin becomes trapped in the ring with the demon. Having learned the demon's secrets and history over the years they had both been bound
 to the ring, the paladin consults the demon about the maiden's fate. The demon informs him that she had been raped by the immortals and would be consumed by them upon returning to their lair. 
\par 
\par The paladin promised himself to the demon if it promised to sa
ve the maiden's life and protect her from the immortals, and the demon pointed out that the paladin no longer had a body to go with the soul he was offering. Freely surrendering his soul to the demon would transform it into a god and allow it to escape fr
o
m the ring, but only if someone found the ring and surrendered their body to it as well. Considering where the ring had been lost, the paladin could not imagine that happening in time to save the maiden. The demon surprised him by saying that time was of 
n
o consequence. Once it had a body, it could return to the moment when the paladin died in order to fulfill its promise. To salve the paladin's conscience, the demon assured him that it would be able to reincarnate the soul that surrendered his or her body
 to it, or him, once it was a god. The paladin asked the demon how long it would take, and the demon informed him that time was subjective in the ring, so it would only seem to take as long as the paladin needed to make up his mind. 
\par 
\par In the objective world
, once the paladin committed himself, the demon became a god and bent reality to his will. Tampering with time produced unpredictable results, even for a god. The future was not a singular thread, but a mosaic of possible threads that was brought into foc
u
s by intent and realized by action. Thus, perceiving the future was a product of being able to perceive intent. The promise the neo god made was a powerful intention, and with it came an obligation to bring about the future he required. Ironically, the pe
rson fated to provide the god with a body was the daughter of the maiden he was bound to rescue and protect. In her memories, the god found the map it had to follow to sustain its suit. 
\par 
\par The god impregnated the maiden, reincarnating the girl as her own twi
n brother. The maiden had fallen in love with the "young man" who rescued her, and the god had been forced into a triangle relationship with the maiden and her intended mate in order to ensure the girl's conception. The god slipped away once the task of r
e
incarnating the girl was completed. Remembering his "curse" and through it having established who was the father of who, the girl's father adopted the boy as his "son" and raised him in the god's absence. The girl finds the ring, but initially was too you
ng for the god's purposes. She played with the ring until she got burnt, putting it away and forgetting about it until later. 
\par 
\par The ring plays a part in the girl's childhood misadventures, helping to establish her as "one of the boys" among the street orpha
ns, though she only used it a few times during her seventh year. The boy inherited "his father's curse" but was trained to remain male by the girl's father--ironically, his true biological father. The boy and girl were separated at birth, and reunited sev
e
ral years later--the specific details to be drawn from one of several approaches. The real purpose for arranging for the boy to be raised a boy was to suppress his memories of his former life. Inevitably, the god would address the consequences of the girl
's resurrection. 
\par 
\par It took a few years for them to meet face to face, as each studied with the god independently up to that point. As a prospective maiden and knight, their lives were devoted to the arts of war and peace. 
\par 
\par At the age of seventeen, when the
ir intimacy finally escalated to intercourse, Ash became caught in the memory of the experience from Ember's perspective and turned into a girl. Over the next few days, the memories continued to unfold and deepen, even though he tried to block them out. E
m
ber tried to help Ash deal with the transformation, insisting that Ash had somehow forged a psychic connection to her. Combined with him becoming her twin, Ember had to ask if the boy had expressed a wish to be her. To his dismay, Ash had to confess that 
h
e had often, privately wished just that. That did simplify things, since it was then just a matter of determining who or what had granted that wish. Searching his own past, Ash remembered being a girl, in brief moments of his childhood, and how his father
 had shaken him out of it. So, Ash went to confront his father with Ember to support him--or rather, her. 
\par 
\par Once Ash had established his identity with his father, his father had realized exactly who Ember was and told them. He told them they were siblings, 
thought to be half-siblings, one his daughter and the other the son of another man. A man who had been cursed by a demon to turn into a girl. At birth, Ash had shown evidence of a similar curse, and had the way he had been raised had been intended to help
 
him overcome that curse. The man had long believed he was Ember's father, though he had not seen her since parting ways with her mother, but the resemblance between Ash and Ember suggested otherwise. They were obviously twins, and the curse had only passe
d
 on to Ash. The two were shell-shocked and retreated to consider the implications. Ash had been raised to fight her true nature, and unconsciously identified with her twin. Ember hypothesized that Ash had unconsciously opened the link that was supposed to
 exist between twins to know the life that had been denied to her. 
\par 
\par Having solved the mystery to their satisfaction, Ember confronted Ash, asking if she really wanted to be a girl. When Ash asked why, Ember pointed out that, stolen memories aside, Ash had 
been raised a boy. Becoming a girl might be what Ash wanted in her heart, but had she given any thought to what that meant. What her future would be like. With Ember to guide her, Ash adjusted to being female, and at some point Ember remembered her own ex
p
eriments with being male. In the past, Ash and Ember had posed as the opposite sex, usually to accompany the other where only girls, or boys, were welcome. Ember decided to surprise Ash, becoming a boy using the ring, and proposing to take her out. The on
ly person who caught them and correctly identified them was their dance instructor, the god. 
\par 
\par The night they went out, they caught the attention of the immortals who had slain the paladin. One of them spotted, and both of them recognized, the ring on Ember
's finger. Remembering that the ring and its wielder could not be separated, they watched and waited, plotting her--or rather, his--destruction. Blissfully unaware, Ash and Ember returned home to confront a different temptation. Ash was fascinated by the 
j
uxtaposition of herself and Ember. Ember was curious about it herself, used to posing as a boy but not used to being one. Having already been as intimate as two people could be, Ember had had no qualms about helping Ash explore her new form, and when Ash 
caught Ember examining himself in a mirror, exploring himself with his hands, she returned the favor. Once he recovered, Ember resolved to return another favor, relieving Ash of her virginity and Ash welcomed it. 
\par 
\par Their mother was somewhat startled to disc
over she had gained a daughter. When she heard the tale of how Ash had come to discover herself, she was scandalized. For the first time in seventeen years, the whole family came together, as mother summoned their biological father to discuss the matter. 
A
gain, the facts argued that he was no relation to the girls, but they favored him over a man who had never made an appearance in either of their lives--as far as they knew. They drilled Ash, but by this point she was committed to remaining a girl, and Emb
e
r did not volunteer the fact that she was capable of taking "his" place. Fortunately, the official birth records identified Ash and Ember as twin girls. To adopt Ash as a boy, the man who raised him had claimed him as a foundling with no known parentage. 

\par 
\par Ash could hardly believe that her life as a girl was official. There were still a few problems, like explaining where she had been all of her life--since her official disappearance. When Ash could not answer the question, most people jumped to rather dark
 conclusions and apologized for asking. Her resemblance to Ember made it unnecessary to explain how she had been found. The immortals were frustrated by the disappearance of the boy they had been pursuing, and continued to keep an eye on Ash and Ember. It
 
did not take long for the unexplained disappearance of the boy and the miraculous appearance of the girl to raise their suspicions. A bit of research into the legends of the paladin revealed enough of the truth for them to realize that the boy they had se
en was one of the two girls. 
\par 
\par The ring had mysteriously disappeared from their possession, within hours of their arrival back at their lair. Learning, now, that the girls were the daughters of the maiden they had abducted to bait their trap for the paladin
, it became misleadingly obvious how they came to possess it. It had been their intention to feast on the maiden to celebrate their triumph over the paladin, but she had been missing too, having escaped or been rescued. Perhaps instead she had just been h
iding, and found the ring before making good her escape. Whatever the case, the immortals were determined to retrieve the artifact. It would not do to allow some mortal to take the paladin's place, hunting down immortals with the power of the ring. 

\par 
\par 
\par 
\par AN: Lucky Number Slevin inspired this twist.
\par 
\par Existing notes present the boy as an unwilling apprentice assassin while the girl was an unwilling cat burglar. The set up is already there. The twist comes in to resolve the conundrum of the ring. Some of the what
 and why do not matter. What does matter is that she stole a ring and the individual who she stole it from had her assassinated for it. That's the straight shot. That is history. The consequence, however, is another thing. The ring was a prison in which a
 demon had languished for ages. The theft combined with the death of the thief resulted in the liberation of the demon, a debt the demon repaid by resurrecting the girl and giving her the means to avenge her own death. 
\par 
\par 
\par 
\par AN: The core of notes featuring a transgendered male first incarnation overlapped by a female second incarnation reached a dead end at the point of transition from him to her.   
\par 
\par A boy driven to manifest his true self. 
\par A deal with a demon. 
\par A girl reborn. 
\par An angel with a debt to pay. 
\par 
\par The demon's suit is emerging as the cause of the temporal loop. In order to engineer its escape from its prison, it tried to step around the law of continuity. 
\par 
\par 
\par A boy and a girl caught in a demon's design.
\par 
\par One was used to recover the ring. 
\par One was used to escape the ring. 
\par 
\par One incarnation is possessed by the demon. The first incarnation submits to the demon to save the second incarnation, allowing the demon to escape and fulfill the suit. Thus, the two incarnations appear to merge in psychic rapport as
 if the body of the first incarnation was sacrificed to escape the demon, or destroyed in their struggle with it. It steps back in time, bears or sires the second incarnation. Thus, the two incarnations overlap from birth. The demon raises the second inca
rnation as its child. It can even be a patron or mentor of the first incarnation, acting to bring the two incarnations together. 
\par 
\par In either case, the boy emerges as a girl and falls prey to a vampire and a were-tiger. A strong possibility being as a consequence of the ring's theft, in the wake of the change over when the girl is believed to have slain the boy. 
\par 
\par If the second incarnation is a boy, he is transformed into a girl and the female first incarnation is transformed into a boy after being possessed by the demon.

\par 
\par It is permissible for the demon to be a god, per the established thread. He is going to remain a player with a vested interest in the second incarnation.
 The degree to which the demon/god can interfere in events may extend as far as it being responsible for causing the first incarnation, conceived female to be born male if required. Arriving before the conception of the first incarnation, the demon would 
h
ave been in position to interfere with the pregnancy and would in fact be required to to fulfill its suit. The genesis of the paradox is earlier in time, so any interference would be within the scope of the spell, altering normal events to achieve its des
ign. 
\par 
\par If the first incarnation is born male, the boy would be raised by his father, betrothed to the girl, and introduced into the theater and associated elements as a part of the bardic tradition of knights. The demon establishes itself as a muse and a pe
er of the boy's mother, and is the mother of a female second incarnation. That would make it a simple thing for the demon to arrange to take the boy on as a prot\'e9g\'e9
, becoming his mentor in "girl" training. The irony of it is that the boy and girl undergo t
he same training, but for different social roles. The "orphaned and unwanted" aspects of both their lives is discarded. A mix of related threads can be woven together, concerning the degree to which the boy's transgender thread is emphasized. 
\par 
\par The incarna
tion order is not relevant in most circumstances. It becomes significant only in terms of how the transitions play out. A female first incarnation provides a more sound plot, as it allows for most of the long term inspirations to be utilized. The demon is
 
able to insinuate itself into their mother's life, as her other lover, impregnating her with the male second incarnation during the same period the original female incarnation is conceived. This reinforces the "two fathers" conundrum present in Avonlea's 
s
tory. Perceived as twins, the two incarnations have a natural reason for pairing up in training and in their misadventures. Being twins, they have an odd intimacy, a natural inclination to conspire with and confide in each other. Circumstances allow them 
t
o cross the bounds of gender to experience brotherhood and sisterhood in addition to being merely brother and sister. His acting and her adventuring give them sufficient opportunities to exchange sex specific knowledge and experience without a metamorphic
 element, making the moments when they have a means to alter their bodies even more significant. 
\par 
\par One way or another, the boy is the one to find the ring. In keeping with the demon working its suit, it is feasible for it to play a part in recovering the ri
ng from wherever it was lost, particularly since it would know. The role the main character plays is providing it with a body to act with. Having the boy come into possession of the ring allows him to reassert his true form, and once he becomes a girl, th
e
 ring must come into the other girl's possession and she must become a boy. The obvious cause would be having her pose as her brother, for some reason, during which the ring is shattered in a fight. Trapped in opposite roles, the two would comfort each ot
h
er and in the spirit of past experimentation indulge each other's curiosity. In the wake of that final intimacy, the demon would assert itself, and attack the girl. Forced to defend herself, she would fight back. The conflict results in the public death o
f her former identity. 
\par 
\par There is a thread in which both are girls and one is slain, and it tends to conflict with the fusion thread, when they are intimate as a boy and a girl, during which they struggle with the demon and sacrifice the male body to surviv
e. There is a variant thread in which the girl encourages her new sister to go out, and over the course of the evening they are separated and the novice girl is apparently slain by the conflicting bites of a vampire and a were-tiger. In one case, they are
 
allies brought together to defeat the hunter who was the former bearer of the ring. Recognizing the ring, recently recovered by another mutual enemy, they acted to destroy the girl in order to recover the ring. It is possible that the ordeal is what unloc
k
s her memory of her former life, if being transformed into a girl did not suffice, but it does stimulate the potential her two lives gave her access to, and in combination with the ring's regenerative powers that is enough to allow her to survive the dual
 infection. 
\par 
\par It is not necessary to follow that path, however. There is sufficient trauma in the slain lover thread, and a natural consequence of it is that it drives her underground, and that is enough to put her into the path of the immortals. 
\par 
\par Clipboard
\par 
\par The night of the party the girls arrived as twins. An immortal was drawn to each of them, but the more experienced girl became worried when they were separated and excused herself to search for her twin. The vampire had drawn the inexperienced girl, Ash
, away from the party and fed on her, leaving her to sleep it off. She recovered quickly because she was wearing the ring, and tried to find her way back to the party. The were-tiger, in search of Ember, found her lost in a back hall, intoxicated by the v
a
mpire's bite, and seduced her back into bed. As things heated up, she realized where things were headed and began to struggle, unintentionally heightening the were-tiger's arousal. She almost managed to slither free, but he caught her, threw her face down
 on the bed and tried to mount her, biting down on her shoulder hard enough to sink his fangs into muscle and infecting her with his bite. 
\par 
\par The were-tiger backed off instantly, as the bite awoke a different hunger. The taste of her blood filled his mouth, 
and if he continued he would succumb to the instinct to eat her. He was tempted to grab her and retreat, but he was distracted by the arrival of the vampire. The vampire had come to check up on Ash. Grabbing the tiger and tearing him off of her, the vampi
re saw the bite and cursed.
