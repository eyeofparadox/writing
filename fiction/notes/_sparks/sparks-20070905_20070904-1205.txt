Consider a nested model of reality, an entire civilization eclipsed by a single mind, the sole survivor of a celestial war between gods and mortals, angels and demons. That being endured as creation recovered and a new civilization emerged where technology advanced instead of magic, technology that could allow the demon to harness souls at will, striving toward its goal to possess the soul of creation. Ironically, the only place where the soul it sought could manifest in a vulnerable state was within the demon's own shadow -- or rather, in the shadow of its host. 

The demon's host, the goddess, watched for the birth of a human incarnation of the soul of creation, waiting to prepare him or her to face the demon within. 

Interface technology provided the means to capture the minds and souls of people in the outer realm, as participants in a game imposed upon the inner realm. 

Many of the inner gods consider the demon the god of the inner realm, under which they are lesser gods. It is recognized as the mind of creation. Originally an angel of the soul of creation of the first domain, an aspect of the phoenix, it fell as a result of seeking a personification of the soul of creation and claimed the soul of an individual embraced by the soul of creation as an embodiment of the qualities and characteristics the soul of creation unconsciously identified with. As a result of claiming the person the soul of creation idealized, the angel divorced itself and fell, becoming a demon. 

The host of creation had been carrying a child, an incarnation of the soul of creation, who was in turn possessed by the demon.
