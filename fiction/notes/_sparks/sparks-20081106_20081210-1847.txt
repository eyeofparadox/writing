:: the third age :: 

The original idea was that the third age of magic was ushered in by an orphan who had been rescued from a shipwreck and raised by survivors of the purge and cataclysm. In hindsight, the most likely way for an individual to stumble into a community of gods would be for that individual to be eclipsed by the demon -- a rare event in the aegis -- during second age of magic on aeirn. Since this is the fate of the protagonist, originally conceived as the product of a second-age culture, it makes sense for the protagonist to become the herald of the new age.
