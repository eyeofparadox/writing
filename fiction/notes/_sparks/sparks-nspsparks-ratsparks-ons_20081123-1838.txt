observations

If the boy and girl are established in splinter realities they can both start out as normal human incarnations. 

If they boy is bitten by a different possessed girl, there is nothing preventing the girl from being infected when she is bitten by a vampire and a were. 

If a different possessed girl bites the boy, the girl's childhood trauma could be at the hands of something else...? 

In her world, the girl assimilated the demon...?



scenes and events


an approaching storm drives the girl and her friends underground forcing her to confront a childhood trauma; a time when she was trapped in the ruins
: 
she is unaware that two events have been combined into one by her patron to block her memory of her true ordeal
: 
near the end of the summer of her seventh year she fell down an airshaft into a flooded section of the ruins
: 
several months later, following the slaughter of her family and the demon's assault on her mind, she escaped through the rift, emerging in the ruins of the boy's splinter realm
: 
she was the only survivor of the massacre in her world, her mind haunted by the demon that possessed her mother
