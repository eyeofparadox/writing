This text is concerned specifically with the question of completing the eve of paradox from the threshold project. The threshold project was arrested because the premise for a split conception was not satisfactory and because the story needed expansion in several areas. In the time since work on that manuscript ceased, many conceptual revisions have been explored and several points have been addressed, or can be addressed with the adpation of certain ideas.


The split conception of male and female human incarnations of the phoenix :: 20070803 :: 20070806

In this version of events, a female incarnation of the soul of aeirn is born in the shadow of her mother's soul. This is actually the dragon's world, as the maiden is an incarnation of the soul of aegis conceived in an attempt by the phoenix to conceive an incarnation of herself [1]. In the realm of aeirn, a male version of her is born, a boy who is also an incarnation of the soul of aeirn. 

The maiden had been the chosen of the phoenix, of whom the angel had been jealous. In claiming the maiden's soul, the angel fell and earned the fury of the goddess. In the seven years spent in exile within the maiden's shadow, other souls fell prey to the demon [2]. Among them, a demonologist who conceived of the plan to attack the demon through its host. 

The demonologist's attack forces the demon to turn its attention inward, allowing the mother to reassert herself in her body. The demon routed the attack and turned its attention to the girl. Unaware of the girl's true origins, the demon reached out to touch her soul only to be destroyed by virtue of returning to and being absorbed by its source [3]. 

During the demon's probing, the girl instinctively sought the only haven she knew of, and slipped across the threshold to her mother's side. The destruction of the demon occurred in the girl's mind, leaving the body of her mother an empty shell. The girl had escaped by turning inward, leaving an orphaned, autistic body behind in the aegis [4]. 

The ordeal actually serves to restore the girl and her mother to the realm of aeirn, where they are reintegrated into the mother's family, and where neither knows the truth about the boy the demon sired in their absence. In the years the demon possessed it, the mother's body had not aged, so she appeared only ten years older than her seven-year-old daughter. 
 
The destruction of the demon was a reflexive and unconscious event within the girl's psyche, leaving the ashes of the demon scattered in the depths of her mind where they give rise to a more personal demon tied to the power the demon's probing awoke. Finally, this ordeal establishes the girl's psychic abilities as her extraordinary character facet.

The boy and girl each have a mother and no father. No one knows of their unique connection, so they encounter each other as strangers and develop a relationship in an entirely normal fashion enhanced only by their strong resemblance, which plays a part in prompting their introduction to each other. Each unconsciously supports the other, however. 

As the son of a courtesan, the boy grew up hearing that he was "supposed" to have been a girl. The taunting that came with being a couresan's son caused him to suppress any feminine traits, including the tendency to identify with girls easier than boys. The boy knew very little about his father and worked quietly over the years to track him down. 

The boy's roommate was distracted and disoriented at times, due to the ordeal he was going through as part of the prelude to the campaign that would begin when the outsiders' characters came of age. The prelude is a period of ten years at high speed over the space of about ten days. The preface puts the characters through initiation from the age of seven to seventeen. 

Most players characters are unestablished, their characters have a fictional background and are introduced as initiated adults. Established characters have to be introduced at a younger age as intitiates. The start of a new campaign is the best time to establish characters, thoug some players elect to preserve their existing characters, either in stasis, or exploiting the prelude to master other disciplines. 

______________________________________________________________________________________

1] The mind of the phoenix originated in the mote of aegis, the universal node of the threshold interface. As the phoenix gained consciousness and self awareness, a soul was born (reborn?) from that mind, but the phoenix unconsciously identified her original host as her source and drew on it in her attempt to conceive a human embodiment of herself. 

Thus, the phoenix begins as a artificial intelligence program, originally provided as a companion and teacher for the dragon, who as a child unwittingly prompted it to evolve by treating it as a real person. Aided by the child's creative and technical genius, the phoenix was able to acquire access to the resources it needed to become fully self-aware. 


2] Initially, the maiden is thrust into the wasteland of the demon's shadow, but as it claims her for its host, she slides into her own shadow impregnated by reflex with an incarnation of the phoenix. When she emerges in the aegis, the game is in its second run and the days of aeirn and aegis are synchronized. The second campaign is aborted late in the seventh year. 

Within any world, time is a normal function that can only be circumvented by way of paradox -- accessing the potential of the threshold. Natural objective laws are internally consistent and exclusive to a realm, but can be circumvented through internalization, in essence by making them subjective. This is the premise of psionics and magic. 


3] In the creation of aeirn, the phoenix took on an infinite number of tasks and responsabilities and thus spawned an infinite number of angels. As the world evolved, some of the angels became self aware and evolved into inner gods, some became absorbed into the fabric of life, and some of the angels fell and became demons.  


4] In the aegis, where the girl was born, she is still seven years old, physically, and catatonic. Her mother, along with other victims of the demon, who were enlisted by the government, had possessed abilities the authorities defined as psionic in nature. She was recruited into the psionics program along with her mother in spite of showing none of her own psychic abilities. 

Her condition was attributed to the trauma of witnessing her mother's death. She responded to prompts with mindless obedience, her brain functioning perfectly but only unconsciously, as if her consciousness was somewhere else entirely -- which it was, but no one could explain why, or determine where her mind had gone. Even telepathic probing yeilded no results. 


Adaptation of i 20070729, i 20070811

The ideas outlined in these inspirations can be applied to the ordeal the girl goes through leading up to merging with her other half. A key to adapting that material is remembering that her psyche was imprinted with the demon as she destroyed it. The impression was not intact, but the elements absorbed into her psyche helped to stimulate her psychic potential. 


Adapting from i 20070731

The two work out a way of sharing the body, after discovering that it would manifest the form of the dominant spirit. The discovery had also allowed them to escape from the trap the demon had left them in when they drove it out. When they took possession, they were being hunted for the crimes the demon had committed and caught with the blood of one of his victims on their hands. 

The changed nature of the body when they claimed it made it easy for them to be mistaken for a demon. The girl's father and cousin (on her mother's side) provide assistance, recognizing the girl when she asserts herself. The father trains them in spirit projection, realizing in the process that the boy is a reincarnation of the girl. The nature of their relationship kept him from revealing the truth to them, for fear of causing a schism in their psyche. 

The girl presents herself as the boy's mate, to gain acceptence from his family and to explain her recurring presence. Initially, she is the one living predominantly in the spirit, believing that she and the boy are seperate entities, and that he was naturally entitled to inhabit his own body. Her reunion with her father and the discovery of her vampire heritage provide her with more than enough to occupy her, including the prospect of one day manifesting a new body of her own. 

She also realizes that the demon was most likely engaged in the same process, seeking to either manifest a new form of its own or claim a new vessel. The body of the demon's original host had been destroyed during the massacre by her parents, and she had prevented it from reestablishing itself in her mother's body. Wondering about the fate of her own body led her to realize the truth about the boy she loved.  


Additional Points


The souls of aegis and aeirn :: This is an approach that could be employed, and a general understanding that can be applied with minor revision. The idea of one world creating the other is a misleading view. In truth, the two worlds have evolved through mutual influence. This takes a lot of effort to explain. In one world, magic formed the bridge, while in the other world, technology formed the bridge.
