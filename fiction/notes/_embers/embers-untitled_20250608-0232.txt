On behalf of Strategy First, I would like to extend my deepest condolences

For Immediate Release

DETAILS OF MAJOR UPDATE FOR WWII ONLINE RELEASED, 30 DAY FREE TRIAL SET TO
START

Dallas, TX - Playnet Headquarters - September 17th, 2001 - Cornered Rat
Software's development team are releasing details of the next major update
to its MMOG, WWII Online which includes additional RPG elements and the
first naval vehicles available in the "Blitzkrieg" theater. The 30 day free
trial period will follow this release (v1.2.5.)

Version 1.2.5 provides players the beginnings of a career advancement path
for their characters. All players will begin with the rank of Private with
the ability to be promoted through 13 levels of rank up to General. Chris
Sherland, WWII Online Producer, outlines this new feature and others as
building blocks for future updates.

"Ranks are RPG 'levels' that will be the basis for players getting their
hands on more game functionality. Right now (v1.2.5) it relates to posting
custom missions. As players gain rank they will have more points available
to post missions. The rank system in 1.2.5 starts players on a character
development path which will increase over time in depth, complexity and
additional features."

1.2.5 offers new vehicles and weapons to players including the German Panzer
II tank, anti-aircraft installations and patrol boats for river combat and
English Channel crossings. The Panzer II is a lightly-armored but powerfully
armed Axis tank featuring a rapid-fire cannon, 30 caliber machine gun and a
top speed of 40 kph. This tank will be a formidable addition for the Axis
players.  The British Riverine Patrol boat, the "Fairmile Model B" is now
available as a multicrew-capable naval vessel with anti-tank, anti-aircraft
and anti-personnel weapons and will be used primarily to patrol western
European rivers. The boats will also be capable of transporting troops to
different locations. Axis players will use "captured" British boats and fly
the Axis flag until the introduction of additional naval vessels in future
versions.

"The addition of these patrol boats opens up all-new areas of gameplay and
is just a taste of the combat to be featured in the evolution of the naval
segment of WWII Online as part of a subscription to 'Blitzkreig'.

Also featured in 1.2.5 are additional terrain elements including dozens of
new towns and villages such as Dover and Calais, river docks and AI
controlled anti-aircraft installations surrounding defended positions.
Another updated feature in this release is the increased number of enterable
buildings in large towns and cities.

Finally, the release of 1.2.5 provides the CRS development team the ability
to finalize the persistent world host providing game play to thousands of
players in a single world. This update is not part of the 1.2.5 client
upgrade but rather is a host-side update, which has been under testing for
several weeks, and will become the primary gameplay environment. In addition
to the persistent world host, an overflow world used for training, special
events and for those times when the persistent world host is at player
capacity will be offered.

Following the successful release of 1.2.5 Playnet.com will begin the 30 day
free trial, which has been suspended since the launch of the game in June.
Expectations are that the 30 day free trial will begin the week of September
9th with paid subscriptions going into effect the week of October 7th.

"We wish to thank the thousands of players who have supported our small team
since June and we welcome new and current players to experience the added
features of this major update to the World War II Online virtual
experience."

                                                                        -30-

Empire of the Ants has a patch

Montreal, Quebec.  September 17th, 2001 - Strategy First and Microids
announced that they have released a patch that fixes a bug found in the
tutorial of their recent release, Empire of the Ants.  The patch can be
downloaded from the Microids web site, www.microids.com.

Empire of the Ants, released this summer, is a unique real-time strategy
game that immerses players in the role of an up-and-coming ant commander
that has been given the task to oversee the welfare and expansion of a
colony of russet ants.  Each player must build up their forces, guard their
anthill, collect food and building materials, and maintain and grow their
colony of ants.

For each mission, players are given specific objectives at the start of each
level, which can vary from collecting of food units to killing the enemy.
Multiplayer mode allows for up to 8 players over LAN or Internet to take
part in multiplayer skirmishes with a wealth of options and play styles;
such as allowing predators into the game area or selecting the Queen into
play, who must then be defended.

ACTIVISION® AND QUIKSILVER FORM WORLDWIDE STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIP FOR
ACTIVISION O2(tm) ACTION SPORTS BRAND

Industry Leaders Join Forces To Cross Promote Action Sports Lifestyle

 Santa Monica, CA.  -- September 17, 2001  -- Activision, Inc. (Nasdaq:
ATVI), the number one publisher of action sports games worldwide, and
Quiksilver, Inc. (Nasdaq: ZQK), the world's largest boardriding apparel and
lifestyle company, today jointly announced that they have formed a strategic
alliance that will cross-promote Activision's Tony Hawk's Pro Skater
franchise and Kelly Slater's Pro Surfer video game through a number of
innovative retail, clothing, event and in-game sponsorships.  The long-term
distribution and co-marketing partnership begins this November with the
launch of two Activision O2 games -- Tony Hawk's Pro Skater(tm) 2x and Tony
Hawk's Pro Skater 3.

The alliance reinforces the Activision O2 brand in the action sports market
by providing Activision with the opportunity to distribute their games
through skate, surf, and boarding retailers, further strengthening the
Activision O2 brand among the core demographic.  Under the terms of the
agreement, Quiksilver will be the featured boardriding clothing brand in the
Activision O2 games which combined are expected to deliver more than 1
billion consumer impressions worldwide for the Quiksilver brand.  In
addition to in-game branding and distribution, the agreement includes
worldwide co-marketing activities, national gaming competitions, in-store
game kiosks and POP materials in Quiksilver Boardriders Club retail stores,
local market consumer promotions and cross-promotional advertising
campaigns.

"Quiksilver is the perfect strategic partner for the Activision O2 brand,"
said Will Kassoy, senior director of global brand management, Activision.
"Like Activision, the company is deeply rooted in the action sports
lifestyle and shares our goal of delivering top quality, authentic products
that enthusiasts know and trust."

"The partnership between Quiksilver and Activision came about quite
naturally," said Taylor Whisenand, director of marketing for the Quiksilver
brand in North America.  "Tony Hawk and Kelly Slater are Quiksilver's two
most globally recognized athletes.  When the best skateboarder and best
surfer in the world are working with a company as successful as Activision,
we will likely jump at the chance to be involved."

About Quiksilver, Inc.

Quiksilver designs, produces and distributes clothing, accessories and
related products for active-minded people and develops brands that represent
a casual lifestyle - driven from a boardriding heritage.  Quiksilver's
authenticity is evident in its innovative products, events and retail

        Digital Leisure Cancels Release of Crime Patrol in Respect of Last Week's Tragedy

Video Game's Subject Deemed Not Appropriate after Last Week's Terrorist Attacks

GORMLEY, Ontario, Canada - September 18, 2001- As America and its neighbors unite in the recovery from terrorist attacks that have shaken and changed our world, Digital Leisure has decided to cancel its upcoming release of Crime Patrol.  The game places players in the role of a police officer stopping criminals - including drug dealers, bank robbers, car thieves, and in the final level, terrorists.

Although the original laserdisc arcade game, Crime Patrol, was produced and released in the early 1990s by American Laser Games, the recent terrorist attacks have caused Digital Leisure executives to put the game's release on indefinite hold.  "In light of last week's events, we feel that the release of Crime Patrol may serve as a sad reminder of the attacks on New York and Washington," said Elizabeth Foster, president of Digital Leisure.  "We have immediately switched our focus to producing Who Shot Johnny Rock?, a  detective game set in the Roaring 20's of Chicago which we hope to release this fall."

The Staff of Digital Leisure and their families are deeply saddened by the horrific events that have occurred.
Our prayers and thoughts are with everyone affected by this tragedy.
