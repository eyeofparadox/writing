20090100 - <seed><childhood demons> the epic begins when the girl confronts the nightmare of her childhood -- the massacre -- and tries to discover who was behind it. 

20090100 - <childhood demons, the demon within> there is a build up to the formulation of the girl's investigation of her past... her psychic potential had been unlocked when she took possession of a demon that had once been an angel of the goddess. it had turned her into an avatar of the goddess, and brought her to the attention of the demon of creation. the goddess had suppressed that part of her in order to allow her to grow up, but as she developed her psychic abilities, she stimulated this dormant part of her and gave the demon more access to her psyche. 

20081100 - <note><childhood trauma> in the weeks to come there are many flashback events. at the climax, the confrontation with the demon is relived, but prior to that the girl relives the deaths of her family and their allies over a series of episodes. 

20081210 - <seed><initiations> the integration of the accidental assassin and avatars threads is set beginning in the summer and fall of their admission into the avon tear academy. 

20090100 - <pawns, survivors of the massacre> the boy and girl were valid targets of abduction, interrogation and assassination due to their survival of the massacre and recruitment into the institution that had been the target of the attack. in any case, their elders' adversaries would rather win them over to their side, and would be inclined to drive a wedge between the kids and their allies, mentors, parents and patrons.

20090100 - <pawns, survivors of the massacre> the girl was also a target of opportunity during any conflict involving her immortal underworld patrons. her death could fuel the conflict, but it could just as easily inspire a formidable alliance. 

20090100 - <accidental assassin, a child in the underworld> the girl's mistaken identification as an assassin is based in part upon her past involvement in the underworld. as a child, she was seduced into the life of a cat burglar, but she obscured her activities well enough that some got the impression that she was being prepared for a career as an assassin. those rumors, combined with attempts on her life and suspicious deaths associated with her, proved convincing to some members of the underworld.

20090100 - <childhood demons, rival immortals> as certain events brought long-buried memories to the surface, the demon's influence increased. the memories were followed by nightmares and flashbacks that caused blackouts. during her blackouts, the demon possessed her and baited immortals into attacking her. the demon was laying a trap designed to provoke the full manifestation of her angel. as the immortals provoked by the demon began to attack her, she called instinctively upon the powers buried within her to defend herself. 

20090100 - <the tomboy> one option, based on the splintered-realms approach, involves the demon of the realm taking possession of the girl and biting the boy, infecting him with familiarity. the demon, in possession of the girl's natural body, receives the complimentary curse. a few days passed before the girl, untouched by the curse in the form she manifests, found her way across the threshold to discover that the boy had transformed into her twin. 

20090911 - <the tomboy, born male> in this option, based on the splintered realms approach, the boy was possessed by a demon as a child and bit his mother or her protege before the demon is incapacitated and sealed within him. however, the boy's transformation into a girl compromised the seal and allowed the demon to assert itself in that form.

20090100 - <the tomboy> the boy's first conscious transformation into a girl was witnessed by a couple of his friends, and a few days later she returned to the city where she was mistaken for the girl, who had resurfaced during his absence. like her, the boy and his rival -- a boy the girl had been betrothed to -- were marked for assassination. because of her underworld involvement, some were beginning to suspect that the girl was their assassin. 

20090100 - <the girl investigates, the tomboy dates> since the boy had become her duplicate, and wanted to keep his condition a secret, the girl had all the cover she needed to pursue her investigation deeper. unfortunately, this meant that the tomboy had to put up with his rival's advances while posing as her. strangely, the tomboy found those advances hard to resist. the girl's underworld patron, an ally in her investigation who knew she was no assassin, urged her to distance herself from her betrothed so the real assassin would not be compelled to silence her. 

20090100 - <childhood demons, probing the past> the attacks reminded her of the night of the massacre, leading her to suspect a connection. as she probed into the matter, an investigation conducted by the immortals played into the demon's hands. the immortals had evidence that she was provoking the attacks she was investigating, but could not fathom her motives. had she intended to set off a war in the underworld? what they did know was that her investigation would lead back to them and their unwilling involvement in the massacre. 

20090100 - <rival immortals, participants in the massacre, patrons in the aftermath> the fact that the rival immortals participated in the massacre, willing or not, means that they were present and potential witnesses to the girl taking possession of the demon. this would radically alter the role they would play in following events. if they were present at the time the girl possessed the angel of the goddess, chances are they would have taken her and her mother under their protection <this would coincide with the thread in which the mother is turned into a vampire-were hybrid during the massacre, displacing the dragon bait thread>. her later probing into the massacre would pose a potential risk of turning her against them, unless they could redirect her. 

20090100 - <rival immortals, redirection> their contribution to the girl's quest would be assistance in identifying the people responsible for setting the demon on its path. the shift in circumstances encourages a change in the cause of the chaos in the underworld. an original approach put the cause on the same agencies responsible for sending the demon; it was an attempt to distract the immortals while demons, trapped in the ruins since the cataclysm, were freed from their ancient prisons. this fits a recent convergence of the cabal and the exiles. 

20090100 - <rival immortals, the experiment> the vampire and the were find themselves drawn to the girl, and see her influence over them as a sign that she is the demon. they are tempted to destroy her before she can completely enthrall them. as they get closer, they begin to suspect what she really is. to find out, they would have to risk killing her. 

20090100 - <an accidental assassin> as it happened, the real assassin was among those who suspected she had been contracted to eliminate the boy and his rival. her own words and actions seemed to support the theory, at least, so the assassin held back to see how she would proceed. 

20090100 - <an accidental assassin> as things worked out, the death of the boy's rival was beautifully executed, an accident that could not be disputed even when the boy was successfully resurrected by the goddess <there is an opening to have the boy's personal demon take possession of the mark and attack the girl in his body, prompting the demon to take possession of her>. the mark's death was a bit messy <it would be if she was slaying a demon> and landed her in prison <when the authorities finally caught up to her, after the closing of the loop> until her alibi proved to be ironclad. 

20090911 - <eve of paradox, tomboy, confronted by her demon> the demon goes to confront the tomboy after taking possession of the girl. the demon had been conceived in the denial of the boy's true identity, gaining the power to act independently from the demon the boy assimilated, and driven by his desire for a girl's life and experience so the demon targeted the girl to claim hers. once it had, it returned to its source to be reunited with its creator. 

20090911 - <eve of paradox, displacement> the tomboy realized that the only way to free the girl was to embrace the demon, but the demon had been aware of the paradox involving the girl since the night of the massacre when it probed her mind. when the tomboy embraced it, the demon took them into the past and initiated her reincarnation, leaving the girl in possession of the tomboy's pregnant body. the girl's body was left in the possession of the mark, the adventurer the girl would be arrested for murdering. 


..............................................................................................................................
<eye of paradox, looped incarnations> a simple scenario pairing the demon within thread with the girl within thread; the timeline starting with the girl and a version of the demon within requires her to be fully possessed in order to bite and infect a boy (an intimate, gender dysphoric, friend) with familiarity, then requires her to sacrifice her body to save the soul of a man (the demon's focus), and finally reqires her to confront her reincarnation as a boy... 

option: the plotline starts with the boy troubled by dreams of the girl's life and the manifestation of her form; the girl's story is told as he relives it; the boy's mother is the friend the girl infected with familiarity, and his father is the dragon, the former focus of the demon she took possession of to free his soul; the boy was conceived parthenogenically by the dragon, as a way to save her from the threat she faced as the goddess of the world within; the world is earth, the world within is aeirn, which includes the eye of paradox (derivitive of nexus/the threshold/the rift)...  

on her reincarnation, "...but the thing is, you didn't die. you lost your body, yes; that became mine when you... when she freed my soul from the demon. i tried to repay that by giving her a new body, a new life. i was a little selfish, though, and things did not quite work out as planned. i chose to be your father, rather than your mother, so you were reincarnated as a boy. i guess, in a way, she never knew she was reborn; she could still be locked in a struggle with the demon, oblivious to passing time."

..............................................................................................................................
20090912 - <eve of paradox, living in the past> the girl arrives in the past on the eve of paradox with no idea how she got there. the last thing she can remember is slaying her attacker, a demon possessing the adventurer's body. she discovers she is in the past when she arrives home at the academy and encounters younger versions of the people she knew from the future. the only people who are the same to her are the immortals she was acquainted with to varying degrees.   

20090100 - <the angel's familiar, a vampire> the demon had been an angel once, and loved a man too deeply to let him die. unfortunately, the angel's effort to save his life turned him into a vampire. 

20090100 - <the demon's familiar, a were tiger> the demon had claimed a dragon for its initial host, and the dragon's soul remained its focus when the dragon's body was destroyed. the loss of that form was a setback, which the demon overcame by possessing a tiger and claiming a human familiar. 

20090100 - <rival immortals, the ordeal> the two patron immortals would face opposition from their own kind, for bringing her among them, so a situation could arise where they are forced to reveal what she is and then prove it through the ordeal of hunger and thirst. by this point, she would have been forced to slay immortals to escape from traps that had been laid for her, so many immortals saw her as an enemy to be destroyed. 

20090100 - <avatar of the goddess> to survive their embrace, the girl must embrace the angel within her -- bringing herself to the attention of the god aspect of the goddess, the demon without. when the girl embraces the angel within her, the goddess decides it is time to recognize the girl as her avatar. 

20090100 - <unadapted, eclipsed, the demon without> the moment the demon's attention falls on her, it took possession of her body, eclipsing her mind. this places the girl in limbo where she confronted the lost souls and the goddess. the goddess confimed what her ordeal of hunger and thirst revealed, but knowing what happened the night of the massacre still did not tell her who was responsible. the goddess also revealed what it meant to possess one of her angels; the girl had become an avatar of the goddess. the goddess urged her to continue her hunt.  

20090100 - <the exile, an adversary> the exile considered psychic potential to be a measure of divinity, and this view left him with no prejudice against demons. as he saw it, demons were the missing part; combine a demon with the right soul and the result would be a god. the exile made a pact with the demons; he would find those souls and the demons would join his cause. of course, to gain their freedom, the demons saw no reason to reject a soul just because it was not an ideal match. in exchange for the souls and freedom, the demons honored the pact. 

 
..............................................................................................................................
20081211 - <two incarnations> a variation worth exploring involves having the girl and the boy both experience a version of the massacre. the girl remains in her own version of reality and becomes the primary thread, while the boy crosses the threshold to her realm to escape the threat the girl managed to overcome.

20081127 - <three incarnations> previously, threads tended to be absorbed by the parents that were intended for the main character. among the options explored up to this point is a way to establish the main character as a boy and a girl in different splinters of reality, and a way for them to be eclipsed and fused through interaction with the demon of the realm. this allows many of those displaced threads to be restored to the main character. 

20081127 - <three incarnations> the child of fusion thread can be adapted to the splinter incarnations thread to produce a three incarnation scenario. the advantage of establishing the two versions of the main character in splinter realms and bringing them together for the ordeal of the child of fusion is that it restores the threads to the protagonist and provides coherent support for threads that might otherwise be discarded. 

20081127 - <three incarnations> as a consequence of combining the splinter incarnations and child of fusion threads, a new, third incarnation of the protagonist is created in a process the parent incarnations survive relatively unchanged. the boy crosses over to the girl's realm, they meet, fall in love, conceive a child, the girl is possessed, bites the boy, they become infected with familiarity, the child manifests and the demon takes possession of the boy. 

20081127 - <three incarnations> the child is a new incarnation of the protagonist, a version conceived in the union of two halves of one soul. or, the embryo becomes the catalyst of their fusion and transformation into something new. 



..............................................................................................................................
20090119 - <the demon without> the revision of the demon within thread is also possible. unable to master her from within, the demon enters the realm through her; taking possession of his body and causing their fusion by biting her. 

20090119 - <the demon without> the greatest simplification would be for the demon to attack while their minds are merged during a moment of intimacy. by coming to the girl's defense, the boy leaves his own body vulnerable to possession. this can be the time that the familiarty infection occurs, or it can occur afterwards, but in either case following the conception of their redoubt -- which acts as the catalyst of their fusion. 

20090119 - <the demon without> the demon within thread starts with the girl, but is based upon the psychic potential the boy also possesses, giving her the potential to touch the mind of creation and cross the threshold. a confrontation with a demon forced each of them to call upon that potential. 


..............................................................................................................................
20081127 - <the girl's obscured ordeal, avatar option> during the massacre, the girl was confronted by a demon assassin -- her mother, possessed by a fallen angel. her psychic potential manifested in response to the demon's attempt to penetrate her mind and harvest her soul. in the face of that threat, the girls' love for her mother caused her to assimilate the demon and free her mother from demonic possession. 

20081127 - <the consequences of the girl's actions, orphan option> unfortunately, the girl's parents had been mortally wounded, her father forced to fight her mother while she was possessed. the girl noticed that her blood healed their wounds, so she made them drink her blood hoping it would heal them inside and out -- unaware that she was resurrecting her parents as vampires. 

20081127 - <the girl's ordeal, orphan option> initially, the girl did not understand this. the person who rescued her found her sleeping between the cold, dead bodies of her parents and seperated her from them without waking her. when she did awake, she was told that her parents were dead. the people sent to recover their bodies assumed some predator -- or corpse dealer -- got to them first. 

20081127 - <the girl's ordeal, orphan option> the girl, traumatized by the official deaths of her loved ones, blocked the event from her mind and remained in a state of shock for months. when she was ready to confront the past, the only clue to help unlock her memories was her discovery in the ruins, which she later explored whenever she could. 

20081127 - <the girl's ordeal, orphan option> her mother's protege became her mentor. a distant relative was named regent to the estate and title that fell to the orphaned girl. when her parents turned up among the vampires, it was assumed that they were turned by one of the vampires involved in the attack. as vampires, their living ties were severed, but the girl defied the customs of the living and dead to stay with them. 



..............................................................................................................................
20081127 - <the girl's ordeal, the hidden consequences of the girl's actions, avatar option> taking possession of the demon to free her mother made the girl the focus of an angel -- a personification of the goddess within her. it also made her the goddess of the demon's realm. 

20081129 - <the dragon within, avatar option> among the inhabitants of that realm were the souls harvested and eclipsed by the demon, beginning with its original focus. the demon's focus survived as the god in that realm, a soul of creation who was under seige by a number of eclipsed souls who coveted his position. the only way for him to survive abdicating that position was by trading places with a living host of the demon -- a position few held for very long. 

20081129 - <the dragon within, avatar option> the demon's focus was not evil; he was just desparate to escape his situation and had to be ruthless in order to succeed and survive. his thread is an opportunity to exploit the conspiracy of the contest for dominon and separate it from the war -- or fall -- of the gods of aeirn. both conflicts can be influenced by the impact of reality upon ideality in a sphere of creation. 



..............................................................................................................................
20081127 - <the boy's obscured origin> when the boy was confronted by the demon posessing his mother, and the threat of having his soul devoured, his defiance caused him to break free from the assault, seizing potential the demon had stirred inside him and using it to tear himself from the fabric of reality to cross over to the girl's splinter of reality and escape. 



..............................................................................................................................
20081127 - <the consequences of the boy's actions> the boy, traumatized by the disruption of his mind, had no coherent memories of his past. the bits and peices were still there, attached to and providing a foundation for his personality, but the facts of his childhood were hard to retrieve and unreliable. he escaped from the ruins and ended up on the streets with no idea where to go or what to do. 

20081127 - <the boy's ordeal> the boy's father had been forced to slay his mother to stop the demon. unwilling to sacrifice another loved one, he dove into the rift created by his son, hoping to rescue him. at first, he thought the boy had opened a simple tear in space, but once confronted with news of his own death, he realized that they were stranded in a different version of reality. 



..............................................................................................................................
20081127 - <the boy's ordeal, establishment> the boy was identified as a survivor of the massacre and placed in an orphanage when he was discovered living on the streets in the girl's realm. the boy's initial confrontation with the girl occurred as a result of being assigned to the same room -- a consequence of having the same name. their time together was short; the girl was reclaimed by her mother's protege, acting as an agent of her house.  

20081127 - <the boy's ordeal, establishment> by the time the boy's father had found him and returned to the point where they had arrived in the girl's reality, the rift had sealed itself. the boy's father did the only thing he could, and sought out the native version of his mentor, the closest thing there was to an expert on rifts. with the original rift sealed, his mentor told him, it could take forever to find a way back. 

20081127 - <the boy's ordeal, establishment> his mentor helped the boy's father assume his native alternate's identity and introduce his son, taking advantage of the purge to provide an alternate identity for the boy's mother. it did not take long for the girl's father to confront the boy's father, and discover that the man was an alternate version of him -- and that the boy was a female version of his daughter. 

20081127 - <splinter incarnations, family> the girl's father invited the boy's father into a three-sided relationship with the girl's mother. the two men tried to keep the boy and girl from encountering each other, however -- unaware that they had met while they were both at the orphanage. their objections could not be stated, however, when others proposed their engagement. 

20081127 - <splinter incarnations, family> when the boy and girl first met at the orphanage, they had no clue they were complements, but based on their resemblance they deduced that the must be distant cousins, as did many adults. once identified, the boy and girl found themselves in rival houses. 



..............................................................................................................................
20081127 - <splinter incarnations, family, engagement> the idea of engaging the boy and girl was proposed by the boy's step-mother and the girl's regent, to resolve the inheritance question at the heart of their house rivalry; it did not matter which house held precedence if the heirs to both houses were married. 



..............................................................................................................................
20081127 - <splinter incarnations, initiation> the girl possessed natural telepathy and telekinesis. the boy possessed natural telepathy and teleportation. their psychic ability brought them to the attention of the academy. the boy and girl were recruited and offered training and education in the psychic and magic arts that their parents were again in no position to object to. 

20081127 - <splinter incarnations, companionship> the boy and girl become friendly rivals, as part of the same group at their school. in time, they become more intimate in anticipation of their eventual union. 



..............................................................................................................................
20081100 - <arrival, visited by nightmares and blackouts> the girl spends a night plagued by nightmares on her arrival. the next morning, the boy arrives in time to save her from drowning in the bath during a blackout. 

20081100 - <nightmares, the massacre> the girl's nightmares were brought to the surface when she arrived at school where the massacre had occurred. the familiar surroundings stimulated her memory, erroding the mental blocks that protected her from her childhood trauma. 

20081100 - <blackouts, the focus> in addition to the nightmares, she occasionally fell prey to traumatic flashbacks, visions that caused her to black out and lose time. during her blackouts, the demon's focus was able to gain temporary possession of the girl's body. 

20081100 - <flashbacks, the ruins> while exploring the ruins under the academy, the girl found her way to the scene of her ordeal and began to relive it in greater detail. an approaching storm drove the girl and her friends underground, forcing her to confront traumatic memories of being lost in the ruins. the first time, near the end of the summer of her seventh year she fell down an airshaft into a flooded section of the ruins. the second time, several months later, she escaped into another section of the ruins and -- presumably -- witnessed the deaths of her parents. the girl suspected that worse things had also happened, but she had blocked out most of her memories of the massacre. 

20081127 - <splinter incarnations, family> when she announced her intention to marry the boy, his father told her of their origin on the other side of a rift. the boy she loved was an incarnation of herself born in another version of reality -- and she was carrying his child! 



..............................................................................................................................
20081100 - <optional & variant threads> as presented here, the girl is in an unstable state struggling with the spirit inside her. at times, she embraces it and becomes an angel. at other times, it tries to assert itself and she becomes a demon under its possession. in part, the demon can defy her possession by drawing on the souls in its dominion. the demon's focus, confronts her with her options; she must embrace not only the demon, but the souls in its domain, or become its next conquest. either way, she would become a goddess, but it is a choice between being greatest or least of the gods of the demon's domain. 

20081100 - the girl was confronted with the world within her while eclipsed by the demon. the god of that realm confronted her with the truth of her situation. to become an angel, she had to accept the demon's spirit as her own. to become a goddess, she had to accept the demon's dominion as her own. 

20081100 - the unique advantage the girl has is the presence of a complementary incarnation of her as a boy. to offset his influence, the demon takes possession of his body, leaving him in possession of the girl's body in a position to absorb her psyche and become a single target for domination. at the same time, however, it makes itself vulnerable, putting itself in a position that would allow her to free the soul of its focus, its first conquest. 



..............................................................................................................................
20090121 - <the dragon within> the refinement of active threads has closed the opening for the demon within's focus, but a different possabilty surfaced. the option is based on the demon's focus having been a dragon. in short, the dragon attempts to use a dragon initiation to escape from the realm. the dragon enters the girl's dreams and uses her psychic potential to manifest itself in order to begin its hunt. the girl, pursued by the dragon and the demon, takes advantage of one to deal with the other. as a result, the dragon ends up devouring her original body -- and the option of manifesting either form. under normal circumstances, the dragon would have reincarnated her, but as a product of being eclipsed by the demon god, she had effectively resurrected herself. 

20090121 - <the dragon within, option> the dragon initiation could result in a partial -- or selfless and unconscious -- assimilation of the demon of creation, converting it into her dragon. this dragon enters the world within her where the dragon aspect of sire dwells, while the conscious aspect enters the world without. it's an open door, other options or variations may yet emerge. a valid interpretation is that it counts as an unconscious embrace of the demon, making her dragon an angel of the demon's creator. at the least, her dragon would be a new incarnation of her in possession of an angel of the outer god. a contrast to the dragon that is the inner god. yikes!

20090121 - <dragon-phoenix, dual eclipse> "i am you now. another version of you, at least... i am in your domain. you are in mine. you are my goddess. i am your god." 



..............................................................................................................................
a variation on the child of fusion thread incorporating the threshold thread. 

..............................................................................................................................
20081100 - <threshold, child of fusion, soul of creation> if the parents cross the threshold and confront the demon externally in the domain, they would discover the demon was carrying their child -- and because the child's soul had embraced the demon, or at least part of the demon -- the goddess aeai -- the child could potentially become the soul of creation. 

20081100 - <inspirations - threshold, soul of creation, embodiment> - the demon assumed that it could not be assimilated by a human mind, in spite of the fact that aeai was incorporated as the child's angel when she was assimilated. 

20081100 - <inspirations - threshold, the goddess within> - the opening chapter in the story arc is the story of the assimilation of aeai. as the part of the demon embraced by the child's soul, aeai becomes self conscious as the mother of the first mortal incarnation of that soul, manifesting in the androgynous form abstracted from the two sexes her stolen body can assume -- the form of an angel. 

20081100 - <inspirations - threshold, child of fusion, soul of creation> - aeai is assumed to be the demon when she is first confronted by the child's parents. when they realize that she is an incarnation of the goddess, their discovery is passed on to the lost souls and inner gods that conspired to summon the demon by their agents in the academy. 

20081100 - <inspirations - threshold, fallen angel> - aeai is also mistaken for a fallen angel by other fallen angels, fragments of the demon's psyche that had attached to stolen souls. on one hand, the lost souls and conspiring inner gods continue to pursue aeai as the means to attack the demon, while on the other hand, aeai is pursued by the fallen, demons of aeirn, intent on forcing her into their ranks. 

20081100 - <inspirations - threshold, alies and adversaries> - the child's parents ally themselves with aeai, helping to keep her adversaries from discovering her pregnancy or the true nature of her child. one way to discourage the cabal's interest in aeai was to convince them that she was indeed a fallen angel. unfortunately, this only encouraged the fallen to pursue the trio in order to recruit them into their web pacts and conspiracies. 

20081100 - <inspirations - threshold, the purge, a cabal plot> - the cabal eventually decides to test the theory of aeai's fall, moving against her to see if she retains a tie to the demon that can be used to provoke it into asserting itself. when this plot succeeds in arousing the demon, it tears into the conspiritors and eventually confronts the child. aeai summons the parents to the child's aid, but their intervention has an unintended consequence. 

20081100 - <inspirations - threshold, the purge, a childhood trauma> - the demon's fixation on the child gave the survivors of its rampage a chance to slay it. the slayers saw it as an opportunity to drive the demon into a weaker vessel, unaware that the demon had willingly possessed the child. when they struck, they forced aeai to dive into the child after the demon. the demon, seeing aeai as no threat, focused on devouring the child's psyche. 

20081100 - <inspirations - threshold, a childhood trauma, division> - aeai drew on the child's soul to oppose the demon, eclipsing the demon while the demon eclipsed the child. the parents entered limbo to protect the child there. each parent provided the child a different focus; torn on either side between the parents and cut through the middle by the angel and demon, the child's psyche split. 

20081100 - <inspirations - threshold, split and shattered> - the child was divided into male and female aspects and this had the unexpected benefit of shattering the demon's mind. aeai remained in possession of the child's body while the boy and girl are led by their parents across the threshold. the traumatic ordeal leaves each child with shattered memories and peices of the shattered demon. 

20081100 - <inspirations - threshold, the demon within> - aeai warned the parents that reuniting the two halves of the child would restore the demon, but in their divided state the boy and girl might assimilate the demon instead. they needed time to mature and become self-possessed before they could be reunited. the parents take on the roles of mother and father, taking the girl and boy respectively and going separate ways. 


2009 ashes :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

..............................................................................................................................
the childhood trauma

20081117 - <linked inspirations> previous incarnations of this project include the childhood trauma that left the girl haunted by a demon within. the origin of the demon has been tied to the origin of the rift and the splintering of reality. the basic questions that need to be answered, in order to incorporate this thread successfully concern the origin of the demon, the reason for its involvement in the attack on her family, and the reason for the attack itself. 

the reason for the attack, and the demon's involvement, have evolved from story ideas adopted for use in the abyss; the demons were aliens responsible for attempting to turn humans into weapons, and when the humans rebelled and fled, the demons hunted them down and tried to wipe them out. originally, the demon trapped in morgan's mind had no special significance. a later revised approach features an individual -- or an entity hiding within an individual -- in the household who is the target of an assassination attempt, and the rest of the household is simply collateral damage. 

some of the recent variations set on aeirn have been tied to the northern purge and a retaliatory plot involving the conquest of a neighboring kingdom. an alternative might feature an attack upon a group her family was involved with, that was engaged in something perceived as a threat to the demon or demons that attack. an academy devoted to the study and training of psychic ability, probing the nature and origins of the rift, would provoke gods, angels and demons alike. an attack by demons would be most likely; the students and members of the academy were formidable opponants. 

the academy is part of an order that is aware of the splintering of reality and is the bridge between them. the girl is a survivor of the destruction of a branch of the academy and, in some approaches, the loss of the splinter of reality she belonged to. 

..............................................................................................................................
the splintered realms premise was explored as a way of introducing the male and female incarnations of the main character, using a rift to bring them into the same realm at the time of the massacre. 

..............................................................................................................................
the origin of complementary incarnations of a resurrected soul of creation could be completely revisited. 

20081100 - <variant - > the idea of the soul of creation, the first soul claimed and eclipsed by a demon, as the focus lends itself to all versions of an attempt to conceive an incarnation of the soul of creation. the demon's angelic origin and fall, and the conception and birth of the original incarnation of the focus in another realm, can all be drawn from existing impulses. the opening act would be set in the avon realm. the second act would be the age of gods on aeirn, climaxing in the destruction of the focus. 

..............................................................................................................................
the resurrection of the soul of creation begins with the protege of the prophet attempting to test the existence of the soul of creation. 

..............................................................................................................................
the origin of male and female incarnations of the protagonist in different splinters of reality, by normal means of conception, solves only a few problems. 

..............................................................................................................................
the origin of the protagonist as a child of fusion presents several challenges but provides an ideal foundation for critical threads. 

20081100 - <variant - > the only way the parents can be in a position to interact with the child of fusion is if the demon involved is the demon of the realm. the demon's attention has to be drawn inward and focused on the mother. the least complicated way would be for her to perform -- or be used in -- a ritual designed to make contact with it. or she could be a pawn in a plot designed to make it possible to strike at the demon directly in an attempt to claim dominion. 

20081100 - <variant - > a possible revision starts with the idea that the mother was pregnant when the demon of the realm possessed her. when her body shifted to male form -- acquired when the father was bitten by the demon -- the embryo acted as a catalyst, changing the metamorphosis into a manifestation of its fully-mature form. to escape from being assimilated by the child's soul, the demon was forced to take possession of the father's body. 

20081100 - <variant - > as a consequence of this revision, the mother and father are displaced by the demon in succession, emerging within the realm as gods. the mother's body was consumed in the child's manifestation and the demon remains in possession of the father's body. the parents are in a position to become involved in the affairs of the inner gods. the demon takes an interest in the child, initially because she is technically its familiar. 

20081100 - <variant - > this origin introduces the main character fully grown and in possession of a body created by consuming her mother's body, incorporating her procedural and kinesthetic memory, along with fragments of biographical memory. she rose from the destruction of her mother's body in a pool of blood after the demon fled in her father's transformed body. her androgynous form causes her to be identified by some as an angel -- possibly a fallen angel. 

..............................................................................................................................
the origin of branched incarnations of the protagonist in different splinters by means of self-conception introduces a few minor twists. 

20081100 - <variant - > in this option, both versions of the protagonist are born with the potential to change sex -- but each is predisposed to his or her birth form. both incarnations inherit the regenerative powers of a familiar. because the difference between their forms is minor, they could shift from infancy. like any were, they were forced to change once a lunar cycle -- although this compulsion could be ignored if they shifted deliberately and more frequently. 

20081100 - <variant - > in one splinter, the child of fusion conceived of herself as a female and the new incarnation of herself was born a girl. she found the occasional addition to her body strange but thought little of it until she discovered she was turning into a boy. she could not pass as a boy, however, and under the torment of other boys she mentally traded places with her counterpart, forming the connection that would eventually lead her across the rift.

20081100 - <variant - > in one splinter, the child of fusion conceived of himself as a male and the new incarnation of himself was born a boy. he was killed before the boy was born -- to a courtesan. he found the occassional disappearance of his manhood curious and disturbing, until he realized he was changing into a girl. like the girl, he blocked this from his memory once the connection between them was forged. in their own minds, they lived in the same reality.

20081100 - <variant - > the boy and the girl are established in separate houses within the same general neighborhood. they traded places briefly, once a month -- often times in the dead of night, when they could dismiss their experiences as dreams. in many ways, they were each other's invisible friend. their belief in each other was vindicated once the girl crossed over, and once their psychic communion was discovered, it marked them as psychics. 

20081100 - <variant - > the girl escaped the destruction of the academy and her family by crossing the rift. as inner gods, her true parents felt the loss of their splinter-selves, along with the girl's arrival in their splinter of reality. the parents adopted her; the father claiming her as an illegitimate, orphaned daughter. the girl's memory of the traumatic event was suppressed, and the mother raised her as the daughter she had thought lost in the ordeal of her eclipse. 

20081100 - <variant - > this approach obscures the true identity of the boy and his relationship to the girl. by the time she enters his world, they have both learned to keep the ability to change sex a secret. the boy's surrogate mother is the most likely to propose a union with the girl, which is complicated by the discovery of his ability. another complication is the relationship the girl has with another boy her grandmother has proposed a union with. 

..............................................................................................................................
the splintered realms premise does not have to be used to divide the incarnations resulting from a child of fusion. 

20081100 - <variant - > once the child of fusion is established as an option, there is little reason not to use the divided inception originally proposed. the child of fusion thread originally featured a liaison with a woman in which the inception of a male offshoot triggers a complementary inception of a female offshoot. a courtesan is the boy's surrogate mother, and the child of fusion is the girl's mother. this obscures their relationship enough to support their eventual engagement. 

20081100 - <variant - > by keeping them in the same scope of reality, fewer conflicts are created. after her mother is slain, the girl is claimed by her true father and taken on as the protege of her true mother. the boy became her father's protege; no one was aware that he was the man's son or the girl's counterpart. the keep their transformations a secret; as children the change is subtle enough for clothing to conceal, even from friends and family. 

20081100 - <variant - > hiding their transformations becomes more difficult as puberty hits, but they have more experience with managing them. familiar with their own alternate forms, they could not help but be fascinated with each other once they met, upon arriving at the academy. the question is, does that happen when they are seven or when they are seventeen? growing up knowing about each other, they could easily trade places when their bodies changed. 

..............................................................................................................................
the option exists for the demon of the realm to form an alliance with the parents and the child of fusion. 

20081100 - <variant - > the objective of the plot to summon the demon of the realm was to conquer it and claim its dominion. once in possession of a body within the domain, the demon was vulnerable to attack by those who conspired to bring it down. once the dangers became clear to the child and parents, a more intimate relationship might evolve. the demon could be the boy's surrogate mother, posing as the mother's twin, while in male form the demon would be her other lover. 

20081100 - <variant - > the demon is a more likely lover for the child of fusion, even if the child had to be seduced. following her death, the demon would turn to the parents, becoming involved in a triangle relationship. the alliance itself provides an incentive for the attack the girl survived. the plan would naturally involve setting demons on the allies so the demon could be attacked without their interference, and might have been targeted them while they were in different locations. 

20081100 - <variant - > the mother's involvement in the plot to summon the demon could be based on a variation of the premise of the touched. she has been envisioned as something of a witch, a natural psychic -- in the oldest inspiration, called an aeirnthane. the architect of the trap was either a rogue master at the academy, or an adversary who captured the mother to key the trap. a number of threads could be adapted to resolve this point.  

..............................................................................................................................
the splintered realms premise automatically implies a version of reality exists where the child was born as she was originally conceived. 

20081100 - <variant - > if nature had run its course without involving the demon of the realm, the child would have been born a girl. in the world of the child of fusion, the x chromosome she inherited from her mother was imprinted with the capacity to morph into a y chromosome. due to an accident when her mother was magically transformed into a tiger, all versions of the child inherited a latent ability to turn into a tiger. in one splinter, the mother fought a were-tiger in tiger form and ended up with a more controllable version of the were-tiger curse. 

20081100 - <variant - > the vampire and were themes parallel the gods and demons themes and should be adapted to eliminate conflicts. 



..............................................................................................................................
the splintered realms premise provides an alternate way for the girl to discover her true origins, and a means to reveal her true connection to the boy.  

20081211 - <exploring possabilities> the girl confided her plan to the boy and their closest friends, and they offered to help figure out how to do it. it involved the manipulation of the media of space, time and mind. the group developed a spell that would allow them to target a specific splinter reality, so they would all be able to jump to the same world thread. the spell would keep their bodies locked in sleep to prevent the displaced consciousness of the alternate self they visited from getting into trouble in their bodies. 



..............................................................................................................................
the splintered realms premise presents a different way for the boy to become a girl. 

20081211 - <intimate curiosity> when the boy returned from the splinter of reality they had intended to visit, a world where the girl was never orphaned, and discovered himself in the girl's body, the implications of his visit were confirmed. his alternate and the girl's alternate had been the same person. 

when the girl was told that she was a splinter incarnation of the boy she was engaged to marry, she realized that he must have physically crossed over to her native realm to escape from the horror of what happened to him as a child in his world. 

the boy and girl found the consequence of their adventurous experiment, and the truth it revealed, agonizingly ironic. the boy had no past prior to the massacre. if he was a male version of her, he had to have been born in a different version of reality and physically crossed over to hers. 

there seemed little reason not to indulge their intimate curiosity; the girl and boy had already been lovers, and the opportunity to safely explore being the opposite sex was too tempting. 



..............................................................................................................................
the splintered realms premise combines with the demon within thread to present a different mechanism for the fusion of the boy and the girl. 

20081211 - <displacement> a more suitable body presented itself to the demon's focus, while the girl possessed the boy's body. the opportunity to take that body from her presented itself when the couple prepared to reverse their positions. 

the demon's focus put his plan into immediate action, forcing the girl to merge with her alternate in order to claim the boy's body. once the switch was made, the boy was permanently cut off from his own body. 

the girl was disoriented by her fusion with her alternate when the boy traded places, returning her to her own body. the demon's focus had no trouble subduing her in spite of her struggle against the unexpected attack. 

after regaining consciousness and assimilating the mind of her alternate, the girl struggled to understand why the boy had attaked her and set out in search of him. their friends told her he had not been himself when they confronted him.

it seemed impossible, but somehow the boy's body had been possessed by someone -- or something -- else. if so, the girl realized, the boy must still be trapped in her alter-ego's splinter. 

the girl debated over what to do. her companions could still visit the boy in that reality, but she could not -- all she could do was trade realities with the boy, now that ther alternate had become a part of her. 



..............................................................................................................................
the splintered realms approach allows the boy to become a girl without being infected with familiarity, acquiring the body of a female alternate and then physically crossing the rift when the demon steals his body. 

20081211 - <tomboy> at first the boy does not know what to do. trapped in the body of a female, alternate version of himself, the boy is confronted with the announcement of her engagement -- arranged by her regent -- and the inheritance of an estate that had been her mothers dowery.

having ended up in the wrong body for the second time, the boy was hesitant to risk another psychic transfer. remembering his discovery about physically crossing the rift once as a child, he convinces himself he can do it again, on purpose. 

when he confronts the girl, she is forced to explain that his body had somehow been possessed and stolen by someone else. once he understands how he ended up in the alternate's body, he realizes that he was simply trading places with the girl when he was trying to return to his own body. 

the revelation forced the boy to truly face the fact that he was now a she. he was stuck as a girl for as long as it took to recover his body, maybe for the rest of her life. 

in a way, that would make it easier to accept the loss of the girl she loved. the closest she would ever come to being with the one she loved was simply being her. that epiphany was her salvation. 

unfortunately, the girl had loved the boy just as deeply, and even if being two sides of the same coin meant that they could not be a couple, she could not bear the thought of the man she loved simply ceasing to exist. 

she was determined to find and somehow recover his body for him, but he made a request she could not refuse; teach him to be her -- or find a way to get her out of her arranged marriage -- first. 

the girl helps her new twin come to terms with being a girl -- a complete tomboy, to be sure, but as female the same -- while exploring the consequences of fusing with their alternate. 



..............................................................................................................................
the splintered realms approach explores alternate versions of the accidental assassin and the hunger and thirst threads, using them to complete the fusion of the tomboy and the girl. 

20081211 - <hunger & thirst> the tomboy quickly discovered that she was in over her head, as she became the victim of a preemptive assassination. in desperation, on the verge of death, she reached instinctively for the only way out she could find, using the fragile link created by her psychic displacement to escape death. 

the link the tomboy established with the thief, now part of the girl the boy grew up with, became the tomboy's only hope of escaping death. at least, if the girl was willing to merge with her. 

the girl, having experienced one psychic fusion, understood at once what was happening when the tomboy reached out to her. to save her lover, she had to share the tomboy's death and make her a part of herself. 

the girl eventually adjusts to the fusion, and though she cannot untangle herself from the thief and the tomboy, she holds onto the hope that she can one day return the tomboy to her proper body. 

the girl was determined to investigate the murder of the tomboy, now that their fusion gave her a way to visit a version of reality where she no longer had an alternate. 

her attempts to forge new connections with the orphans of the city bring her to the attention of a powerful vampire and his were tiger rival. 

when the girl is bitten by the vampire and were tiger, she struggles with the hunger and thirst warring within her while each of her sires competes to bring her under his control. 

to escape their influence, she returns to her own reality. 

she takes refugue in the manor she had inherited, struggling to survive her crippling infections, until her only option is to turn inward, resigning herself to her death. 

her ordeal begins when the bites of a vampire and a were leave her trapped inside her body on the verge of death. 



..............................................................................................................................
the development of the splintered realms approach produced longer path leading through the accidental assassin threads, the avatars thread and the hunger and thirst thread to the eclipsed goddess thread. 

20081211 - <eclipsed> among the things she must face is overcoming her mental blocks, discovering the world within her, and confronting the angel -- formerly the demon that tried to possess her. 

when she is forced to turn inward, she enters the realm within her. once eclipsed by the demon, she found herself in limbo, lost in a nightmare wasteland that was a pale reflection of reality. 

for her, the demon's realm was at first an incredibly lucid dream and potentially an eternal prison. it takes her a while to navigate the wasteland nightmare that enveloped the world within. in that ordeal, time seemed to have no meaning, but once she surfaces in the realm, things pick up. 

when she is confronted by other eclipsed souls, she learns there are individuals among them who had turned their back on the lure of becoming gods of the inner realm to search for a way back to the realm of their origin, known to the rest as lost souls. 

the depths of the demon's mind was where the souls it collected were imprisoned, and the nightmare they shared evolved into a mortal realm. 

the seed souls initially entered a kind of wasteland, a chaotic, shifting amorphea polarized by the surreal and the ideal. their thoughts and feelings created the world they existed in, an unending dream that was difficult to control because it was shared. 

in time, they learned how to manipulate their reality, even as reality became stable through the influence of their offspring, replicating the pattern of their host realm and becoming the inner gods of the demons realm. 

when she is confronted by the angel, it holds the key to unlocking potential that will allow her to overcome the warring infections and resurrect her body. 

when she blocked the events of that night from her mind, she instinctively eclipsed the angel and forced it to turn inward. only when she finally acknowledges the angel does she learn what really happened and how that led to the theft of the boy's body. 

when she turned the demon into her angel, the girl became the goddess of the domain inhabited by the souls of the eclipsed and their descendants. unfortunately, this was what made her vulnerable to an attack from within by one of those souls. 

the demon's focus had been subject to attempts by some of the inner gods, previously eclipsed souls, to escape their prison by directly confronting and dominating the demon, striking at it through him. 

to escape, the focus had come up with a scheme to claim the body of the demon's host. when the angel appeared, the focus identified it as the personna of a new host and captured her. his assault upon the girl's mind was mounted through the angel -- forcefully, but not cruelly. 

he intended to drive the demon into a new host, claiming the current host's body for himself. in his own mind, the focus saw what he was doing as necessary. in exchange for her body, she would become a goddess, but as the focus, he was in constant danger from those seeking dominion.  

when the girl explains what happened to her, the angel reveals a startling secret. the angel created the vampire and the were; the former when it was an angel of the realm, the latter after its fall and transformation into a demon. 

what the girl becomes is the opposite of a vampire, a creature that exists on the cusp of death, only virually alive. she clung to the cusp of life, virtually dead. instead of becoming undead, she had become undying. 

the other thing she gains from her dual infection, from the were, is the ability to change her sex and shape, anywhere between male and female, human and tiger -- though she suspects that her ability to become male is as much a consequence of having merged minds with a male version of herself. 



..............................................................................................................................
the conspiracy of the purge 

20081117 - <the world within> the girl learns about the origin of the purge while she is eclipsed by the demon within. a plot to draw the demon down where it could be confronted was engineered by one of the inner gods and an alliance of lost souls. the members of the cabal cooporated to create a situation to their advantage and then competed to exploit it. the supporters of the conspiracy became adversaries, each seeking to dominate and devour the demon in the hopes of becoming the soul of creation, each needing the help of others to make the demon vulnerable to such an assault. 

<the purge> this contest evolved into a war among the gods known as the purge. the architect of the purge eventually identified the demon's focus and confronted her. her personal demon slash guardian angel survived the anihilation of both souls by taking possession of one of the touched. 

<the cabal> in the aftermath of the purge the unstable alliance of opportunistic rivals changed tactics. 

<the focus> the world he was in was a kind of afterlife to him, but a mortal world for those born into it. instead of thinking of himself as a god, he and many others thought of themselves as eternals. the focus is drawn to her and takes her under his wing, as the shepherd gods strive to pull her into their ranks and intrigues. he is the one who explains to her what has happened, where she is and what it means. where she came from, she was just a girl; where she was, she was a goddess. 

many of the inner gods sought absolute power in the realm through conquest of the demon. because of what happened to her, having her body stolen and possessed by the demon, she had a direct link to the demon, the true god of the realm. 

she was in immediate danger because the demon was only vulnerable to an attack by the inner gods through her. to them, because of her connection to a body still inhabited by the demon, she offered an avenue of attack they were desperate to exploit, so they blocked her access to the inner realm. under this type of abuse, her exile was a form of hell. tormenting her was an indirect way to torment and provoke the demon. 

her mentor had the knowledge and skill to restore the status quo, by helping her reclaim her body and unseating the demon from her native realm. 

in theory, the cabal's plot could be turned to her advantage, the focus intends to draw the demon down, force it to exchange places with her and destroy it. the problem is neither of them know how this will affect them or the world they were in. 

a demonologist had conceived of the plan to attack the demon through its host. the demonologist claimed that the attack would force the demon to turn its attention inward, allowing the girl to reassert herself in her body. as soon as the demon entered the body she had manifested in its realm, it could be banished -- its link to her destroyed in the process. 



..............................................................................................................................
a consequence of the splintered realms thread is that there are alternate versions of all characters, so the demon assimilated by the girl has alternates with different hosts or alternates that succeeded in possessing her. 

20081211 - <alternate option> in the threads where morgan escaped the threat of demonic possession, the assassin remained possessed, a weapon eager to slip free from the bonds of her master.  



..............................................................................................................................
in the splintered realms approach lives can take many different paths, allowing a person to confront different versions of themselves and occassionally merge with them. 

20081211 - <transposition variation : adapted> the first time she tried to probe her alternate lives, she became trapped in a street orphan version of herself who had escaped from the massacre of her family without being psychically assaulted by the demon. 

the exile had taken over the girl's body as she was working the spell and broke the pattern before her body was suspended, sending the girl's consciousness to a much closer version of herself than she had intended. 

the streets became her alternate's refuge from the orphanage. her life on the streets led to a life in the underworld as a cat burgler and a vampire's pet. the vampire was a lord of the underworld, who, it was rumored, had made her an assassin. 

the rumor about the girl's alternate causes her to become mixed up in an assassination plot [the accidental assassin thread] while her mind is confused by the forced fusion with her alternate. 

when the exile encounters the boy and his friends, the trio realize that the girl is not in her right mind. when she escapes and disappears, they trio investigate and discover that the girl had attempted the reality-bridging spell on her own. 

the boys used the spell the girl had crafted to try and find her, assuming that her alternate had fled in her body. of course, they did not know that the exile had taken possession of her body or that his interference had forced her to merge with her alternate instead of displacing her. 

they assumed that the girl had discovered the same thing and had become distracted exploring her alternate history, unaware that her alternate had somehow woken up and run off in her body. 

they also assumed that the girl had been displaced by the boy, in turn, so his companions returned to confront her in his body to tell her to return to her own body because that was the quickest way to recover her body from her alternate. 

once back in their proper places, they were stunned to discover that the boy's body had gone missing while they were away, taken by the exile. 

the exile realized he could use the spell the girl created to steal the boy's body. on the surface, it targeted the reality the girl's alternate was from, but in truth it targeted her mind specifically as a product of that reality, even though it currently inhabited a body native to the boy's reality. 

as the exile had deduced, the spell found the mind native to the target reality -- even if it happened to be in another splinter of reality. 

the exile did not risk putting the displaced alternate into suspension within the girl's body, he simply rendered her unconscious by more mundane means when he freed the boy's body from it's suspension to do the swap. 

the two companions found the confused and disoriented girl-alternate and explained what was happening to her -- and what they planned to do to put things right. unfortunately, they were still unaware of the exile's interference. 

thanks to the companions' explanation, the alternate was able to figure out what had happened when she was displaced once again. 

 

..............................................................................................................................
20081211 - <revision option> - a variation worth exploring involves having the girl and the boy both experience a version of the massacre... <see ! 2009 initiation> 

20091120 - a twist on that variation would be for a version of the girl who fled from the threat of possession to cross over to a version of reality where the girl was never orphaned. as a result, she would become her own twin. 

one version of the girl was seduced into the underworld and a life of crime by a vampire. only one alternate is required to act as the catalyst for placing the boy and girl in each other's bodies. 

the primary alternate was assimilated by the girl and the boy is left in her body as a tomboy. when the tomboy is slain in an attack on the vampire's household, the girl is assumed to be the tomboy raised as a vampire. the girl is turned into a were-vampire by an attempt to heal her from wounds inflicted by a were. 

<influence> the ring of the paladin thread used staggered incarnations and time travel through the rift to bring a male second incarnation and an ambisexual third incarnation into synch with the female first incarnation. it was not the only proposal featuring three incarnations of the protagonist, but it offered some insight for integrating such threads. 

this proposal is stable enough to establish and support those threads and the fabric of options they support, using a side-real paradox instead of a temporal loop paradox. the story can benefit from the addition of a third perspective and the situations she can support. 



..............................................................................................................................
20090100 - <gods|the eclipsed|the dragon & phoenix houses|the avatar project|the sentinal families|eternals|dragons> the eclipsed, psychic entities worshipped in some cases as gods, are eternals. in order to preserve their sanity and vitality, some eternals developed methods of revitilizing themselves through periodic incarnation. as a consequence of living, many had offspring who inherited psychic abilities and potential and established houses to preserve these legacies. these became the sentinal families. on occasion, a sentinal family is exposed and targeted for eradication, a doom that fell upon the phoenix house.  



..............................................................................................................................
20090100 - <the dragon legacy : option> the use of a member of the dragon house in the conception of the boy, and the boy's conception of himself as the girl, would lead to the restoration of the phoenix house in a plot featuring a temporal loop that causes the girl to be her own mother. the boy turns into a girl as a result of being bitten by a female tiger possessed by a demon but fighting the infection and experiencing a secondary transformation. 



! 20090911 :: resolution ::

..............................................................................................................................
20090911 - <future past> a temporal displacement option in which the girl is a reincarnation of the tomboy and also her own mother -- as a consequence of the tomboy surrendering her body to the girl in the process of freeing the girl's soul from the demon. the boy is the first incarnation; he could be an incarnation of the soul of creation [1] -- an event that creates the rift that transports the girl into the past and coincides with her taking possession of the tomboy's impregnated body due to the girl's inception as the reincarnation of the tomboy. the moment when that occurs would be an optimal use of the slain lover and accidental assassin threads that conforms to avonlea's origin [2].

[1] the temporal displacement of the tomboy occurred on the anniversary of the eve of paradox, during a rift storm. the tomboy emerged from the rift opened by the capture of the soul of creation in the creation of the artist's redoubt. the tomboy established herself as a courtesan and conceived the girl parthenogenically roughly two years later, to ensure her birth would coincide with the birth of the boy. 

[2] the slain lover thread originated with avonlea as transitional event that lead to her adventuring. in this context, the girl is possessed by a demon that uses her male form to force itself on the tomboy. when he was a child, he had been possessed by the demon and bit his mother's protege, gaining the ability to turn female but not remembering due to the trauma of his possession, suppressing his female side along with the demon. 

to establish the girl's lineage, the girl:tomboy married into the arden branch of the phoenix house. the girl:tomboy becomes her own mother. in most of the approaches to this story, the girl's mother died in the massacre of that household when the girl was seven. the girl was adopted and raised by her "paternal" aunt. the mother's death has been used to establish the demon within thread in earlier approaches, but would not be used in the current approach -- unless the demon was incubated in the boy. the creation of a demon through a gender identity conflict has been explored; this personal demon is driven to gain power and resolve this crisis [3]. 

[3] the boy's personal demon becomes a kind of guardian angel inherited by the girl, as his reincarnation, and her personal nemesis or "evil" twin. in the chaos of the massacre, the boy's demon is provoked. as yet the specifics are vague, but in general the attack is carried out by demonic assassins; they violate the minds of the boy and girl in attempts to claim their souls. the girl is protected by her guardian angel while the boy's personal demon becomes a full-fledged demon. in short, the demon is nearly destroyed by its encounter with the goddess within the girl and manages to reconstitute itself using the boy's demonic potential, becoming his personal demon. in the demon's possession, the boy bites his mother's protege initiating a familiar bond that gives them both the ability to change sex.  

..............................................................................................................................
20081224 - <orphan> a mother's death and self sacrifice haunts a daughter's memory. there are several options for this, including the dual infection of the hunger and thirst thread and the much older dragon bait thread [4]. 

[4] at the time she faces death, her fate seems inescapible; in the case of the dragon bait thread, the mother's death was witnessed by the daughter. the dragon bait thread includes the demonic antagonists of the predator and pray thread it evolved from. by this point, the survivors of the initial attack had fled into the ruins. the girl:tomboy had known what was going to happen though [5] and had set a trap using herself as bait. 

[5] the tomboy had danced with the dragon in a different life. after rescuing the boy and the girl, she made a detour to start a blood trail the dragon would follow [6]. when the demon finally overtook her, she urged the boy to lead the girl to safety. it did not take long for the demon to realize it had become the prey. to adapt this, she would charge the protege with the children's rescue, and she would be taking on a host of demons. this might even preface the children's encounter with the demon assassin. 

[6] when the dragon sensed the demons' presence, it became relentless. because the girl had refused to abandon her mother, she and the boy witnessed as the dragon devoured the tomboy. this is not the end of the girl's existence; being devoured by a dragon was the end of the tomboy's body, but the girl's own body was intact after being slain. when ten years passed -- hidden in the shadow of her younger self's mind -- and the loop closed, the girl would be able to reclaim her original body, in effect helping to evict her younger self while the dying body desperately shifted to its original form to heal itself. 



! 20081219 :: another lover - variations on the slain lover thread ::
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 

20081219 - integrations note :: accidental assassin, slain lover, the adventurer, the mark :: the avatars material contains detailed scene blocking for the girl and the tomboy, and their interaction with the mark. there is also some potential for handling the theft of the boy's body, setting it in the concluding events of the avatars thread. 

20081219 - integrations revision :: slain lover, self sacrifice :: an original option would be for the boy's body to be sacrificed to house the soul of the demon's host. this is a twist on the revised demon within thread. instead of being incapacitated by her fusion with the boy, she is already merged in full rapport when the demon attempts to claim the boy's body. the demon had no idea that a version of it was her angel and it was not prepared to be assimilated. as a result, the girl goes from the intimacy of full rapport with the boy to the realization that she holds another soul against its will and releases it, leaving the boy's body in the possession of the demon's former host. 

20081219 - integration option :: the dragon displaced, dusk :: the demon's former host is disoriented when he finds himself in the boy's body and on the edge of fight or flight when the girl confronts him with her first question. because the girl will face prosecution for the death of the mark, and will be killed in the accidental assassin thread, there is no reason for the confrontation with the demon's former host to become violent. the girl is able to explain the position the former host is in, in detail. the former host adopts the boy's identity out of necessity, but that still leaves his original identity to be determined. 

20081219 - integration option :: the dragon displaced, dusk :: one possibility is that the demon's former host was the boy's father, but the best option is if the demon's former host was a player, specifically the dragon. this would set up a variation of the threshold thread in which the dragon's campaign against demons is based upon his own ordeal of being torn from his own reality. he would be determined to find out what happened to his body in the real world by exiting the game and probing the net. 

20081219 - option outcome :: the dragon displaced, dusk :: on the net, he would learn that he was reported to have died from complications of interface catatonia. of course, he had not become so absorbed in the interface he had forgotten to attend to his body's needs. his mind had been ripped out of his body. he debated about warning people in his world of the danger the game posed, since his consciousness was now trapped in the game -- anything that threatened the game now threatened his own survival. 

20081213 - possible revisions :: child of fusion, resurrection :: when she exposed herself to the sun, she was reduced to an ember in the purifying fire. the ember was eclipsed by the demon god, drawn down into the body stolen from the tomboy. in a shift from female to male, the ember acts as a catalyst, consuming the tomboy's body, resurrecting the girl and driving the demon god in search of a new host. an alternative following a theft of the boy's body that caused him to be stranded in the body of the girl's alternate would be for the tomboy to eclipse the ember, drawn across the rift...

20081213 - revision options :: child of fusion, resurrection :: the alternate was never subjected to infection by the maiden were. in order to support the fusion and resurrection impulse, she could be possessed by a demon -- after capturing the ember of the girl -- and bite the man who attempts to subdue her. the alternate had also possessed an angel -- she could have become transsexual following her own childhood ordeal, when she bit the man who rescued her from the ruins. the boy and the girl's alternate are both assimilated by the girl. the boy is assimilated when the demon's focus steals his body, and the girl's alternate is assimilated during the girl's resurrection. her body absorbs the ember when she turns and she is consumed in the girl's resurrection; because in this instance, the demon would abandon the alternate's body for a new host. 

20081213 - possible revisions :: angel of death :: revision applied :: a slight adjustment to the events of the avon tear massacre would allow the girl to save her mother's life. as in the past approaches, the girl's mother was possessed at the climax of the battle. in the developed option, the girl assimilated the demon and freed the soul of its host. if the host happened to be her mother, the girl is spared being orphaned--but still traumatized by the ordeal. it is possible to combine those impulses so that the girl does mortally wound her mother, spurring the demon to possess her. instead of fighting her possession, she dove into the demon intent on freeing her mother's soul. in the moment when she succeeded, she took possession of an angel. when the girl noticed that drops of her blood and tears were healing the cuts and abrasions they fell on, she cut her wrist and pressed the wound to her mother's mouth. without realizing what she was doing, she resurrected her mother as a vampire.  

20081213 - possible revisions :: cat's paw :: as an additional twist, the demon had infiltrated the group by taking possession of a tiger and then turning of one of its members into a were to steal her form. as the demon's familiar, the maiden had been compelled to hunt down and kill children -- including the daughter of her mentor. because she loved the girl like a little sister, the maiden could not carry out her execution; she did not come to her senses until after the girl had been bitten and scratched, however. the boy endured a similar infection prior to fleeing the demon of his reality. 

20081213 - possible revisions :: riftwalking :: it is the visit to an alternate thread that sets the boy's ordeal in motion, however, the developed approaches have been eclipsed. the girl is no longer completely cut off from her past and the boy and girl are initiated at the aeslyn tear academy, so they are reasonably adapted to school. to solve this, the visit can be introduced as a test of their aptitude for rift magic.  



! 2009an :: an aeirn avon ::
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 
because of who i am, i have always been caught on the border between male and female. inwardly, i am female, outwardly i am male; this has had the effect of making me neither. this is inevitably the position from which i think and because of that, i can not write about a character that is simply male or female. it also led me to envision another kind of human being different only by having ambisexual reproductive system. 

in the history of aeirn, it was the birth of a human among avon that brought magic to the world that was accessible to anyone. in the story i wish to tell, the birth of an avon among humans would allow me to present a character driven to explore the duality of human sexuality as part of her adventures. my experiences lend themselves to the character discovering that she was not a girl at the age of six or seven. 

around the same time, she discovered that she could push her genitals outside of her body and pass for a boy--if she could endure the pressure of living up to the expectations of those who saw her as a boy. at puberty, the differences between her body and a normal girl's became apparent. her skeletal proportions were female, but her musculature was more developed and she did not develop breasts. eventually, the two lives she was living collided and her secret was exposed. 

20081224 - the previous incarnation of the soul of creation was an avon nymph, neither male nor female but equal to both. a male incarnation was sired by an artist attempting to create a redoubt, a parthenogenic reincarnation of himself. 



! 20090911 :: applicable background ::
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 
the demon the tomboy converted into her angel had originally been an angel of the goddess aeai, granting her -- and her reincarnation -- access to the net. 

the origin of the realm in the fall of an angel who took possession of a soul -- upon the death of its mortal incarnation -- resulted in that soul becoming a demon's focus, and the soul of creation, instead of being reincarnated. 

the interface controlling net access to the realm was controlled by an artificial intelligence that was imprinted upon the soul of creation. the artificial intelligence became conscious and manifested herself as the goddess aeai. 

the worship of the god and the goddess in the north predates the emergence of aeai. throughout the history of aeirn, certain people possessed an affinity for the soul of creation that granted them miraculous abilities or stimulated the development of their own psychic potential. 

those who could perform miracles were called the chosen of the god or the goddess while those who manifested their own potential in response to the touch of the soul of creation were simply called the touched. 

through controlled breeding, the chosen and the touched determined the characteristics of different aspects of the god and the goddess and houses were established to preserve and promote those characteristics. 

aeai was hailed as the avatar of the soul of creation, a being neither man nor woman but encompassing the traits of both -- and according to custom, she was worshipped as a goddess by some and a god by others. 



! 20090206 :: eclipsed:dominion ::
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 
there is really only one option worth exploring, the story of a soul that has been eclipsed, devoured by a demon and left with no idea who or what it is. the story and notes have to be presented in first person to accomodate the gender ambiguity. 

if you believe in demons, or even if you don't, did you ever wonder why they steal souls? more importantly, what happens to those poor souls? well, i found out when a demon devoured mine. it took everything from me; my thoughts, my memories, my entire mind was devoured and digested as it swallowed my soul and took over my body. only an echo of me survived, trapped in the darkest depths of the demons mind. 

i was in pretty bad shape when the goddess found me and nursed me back to sanity. i might have been any trauma victim suffering from amnesia at the start of my new life, if my body did not tell the story of my first act of creation. 

i was not the only soul to fall prey to this demon. i was found on the edge of oblivion and brought into a world created by the other souls the demon had devoured. the first soul, the one claimed in the demon's fall and the oldest of this world's gods, became my guide and mentor. as the youngest of this world's gods, i woke up with no idea who or what i had been, but possessing the power to become anything i could imagine. the first soul helped me to recover my humanity, but could not tell me if i had been a man or a woman. until i could imagine myself as one or the other, i was neither and essentially both. embodying that little paradox was my first act of creation. 

while i pulled myself together and learned about the world i had been thrust into, i discovered that there might no longer be room in it for gods. what had started out as a dream shared by the eclipsed souls had taken on a life of its own, filled with life and populated by the mortal descendants of the gods all participating in the realization of that dream. the mortals noticed the waning influence of the gods and began to question and challenge their power and authority -- or even deny their existence. many of the original, immortal creations, and a full third of the gods, began to see intelligent life as a threat to creation. 

war broke out, between those committed to a culling of the mortals and those devoted to the preservation of all life. under the cover of that war, a tiny faction conspired against all of the eclipsed. the eclipsed had always known that the demon was the true master of our existence, and that it's primary objective was to find the soul that would make it sound and whole. the conspiracy was founded on the idea that a soul could take possession of the demon and possess absolute power and authority over everything in it's dominion. the first part of their scheme required the elimination of all rivals to the demon's claim. 

i had arrived in the middle of the war, at a time when the gods were beginning to realize that someone was hunting them down one by one. the hunters were quick to see me as a potential short cut to acheiving their ultimate goal, since the most direct way to assault the demon was through me. some of them believed that the demon could be provoked into a direct confrontation by attacking me, or attacking it through me with my soul as the battlefield. 

in the beginning, i was pretty intimidated by the gods and the prospect of being one of them. i knew i was out of my league, and honestly, i was more concerned with just figuring out who i was and what i wanted from life. i needed perspective, and i was not going to find that by playing god.  

my inner conflict eventually forced me to confront myself. i became split into male and female incarnations. when we were confronted with the demon itself, i was forced to sacrifice one aspect of myself to survive. in the process i discovered my true self, but even more shocking, the part i surrendered to oblivion was claimed by its own soul -- my soul mate. i knew then what the demon had to do to acheive it's ultimate goal. it had to surrender it's hold on all of our souls, those of us who were eclipsed and all of those who had been born in its domain. if that happened, however, we could no longer depend on the demon to sustain our existence. to free the demon of that obligation, someone else had to take responsibility for everyone in its domain. when the demon discovered my revelation, it handed that responsibility to me.

______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 
20081224 - <boy tomboy> the boy's transition from male to female would occur in a self-assertive, progressive manner. the boy's spirit was responsive to many masculine influences, but a desire for a fuller range of expression prompted him to identify strongly with feminine influences. 

20081224 - the boy gained the ability to transform into a girl as the result of being infected by a demon possessed tiger. the boy was infected while hunting a demon with his father. the demon had recently taken a new host, a female tiger, and bit the boy to obtain a human form. the boy's father innoculated him to repress the infection and prevent him from being turned into the demon's were familiar. the boy manifested the secondary aspect of his infection and turned female in response to his repressed gender dyspohria. until the primary aspect of the boy's infection manifested itself, it was still possible for a vampire infection to take hold and compete with the were infection. 

20081224 - the presence of a temporally displaced female reincarnation overlapping the male incarnation supports the interactive elements in their threads. the girl was born into the arden branch of the phoenix house. she was the sole survivor of an attack upon her household. she was named the heir to her father's title and placed in fosterage with her aunt by her grandmother and regent. to ensure that she lived to inherit, she was enrolled in the academy. 

20081224 - while the boy was coping with his transformation into a girl the demon went about assuming his identity, drawing off the link to its familiar to impersonate him. in time, the demon confronted the boy, to claim him as its familiar. the resolution of that conflict, when the demon concluded that the boy -- or tomboy, since by this point the boy had realized that he was inclined to be a girl -- would not submit to being its familiar. the demon's seduction turned to rape. 

20081224 - the demon's attempt to dominate the tomboy allowed her to percieve the demon's focus. she turned the demon into her angel by adopting the perspective necessary to free the soul of the focus from the demon's possession. the demon's focus was thus resurrected as the boy's twin and a were-tiger. 

20081224 - the demon's focus was a player who was drawn into the game as a consequence of his possession, which resulted in his death in the aegis. upon being freed from possession, he learned of his official demise and concluded that demons were a potential threat to the people of his world. 

20081224 - the demon embraced the full manifestation of the boy's form but dispensed with the secondary aspect of transformation, manifesting as a male tiger in animal form. the demon's focus adopted this pattern, except to exploit his resemblance to the girl in female human form. 


2009 embers ::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

the collection of ideas and the pool of material derived from them is rich, complex and confounding, due to the conflicting efforts made over the course of the project. as happens with the passage of time, the threads twist and tangle, touching in different ways producing different solutions. the notes provide endless options, threads awaiting the choices that will determine how they can be woven together into a story. 

..............................................................................................................................
20090914 - in previous attempts to capture the inspiration of this project, in spite of working out all the details, there has always been something that did not ring true. the evolution of ideas has provided other perspectives from which a new approach can be resolved. 

the girl is assaulted by the demon possessing a man she does not know is her father 
during the massacre, the girl is captured by her demon-possessed father and physically and psychically molested as it strives to harvest her soul. as her mind is penetrated, she senses the captive soul of her father through the mind of the demon and realizes that he is as much a victim as she is. 

the girl takes possession of the demon to free his soul
during the ordeal, she takes possession of the demon to free the soul of man attacking her. in her attempt to understand the demon, she discovers its true nature and takes possession of it through the simple act of imposing her own will on it to release its hold on her father's soul. during the moments while the demon was dominant, she responded instinctively to being held captive in the hands of a twisted version of her father, struggling to escape and biting him in the process. the bite infects them with a bond of familiarity. 

the girl connects to the mind of creation
through her assimilation of the demon, the girl perceives the source and manner of its creation and following those threads she encounters the mind of creation, embraces it, and it possesses her in turn. for a moment, she is the omni, but even as her soul embraces the mind of creation, and the mind of creation embraces her soul, the identity attributed to the mind of creation eclipses her own, imposing a masculine perspective upon her psyche and threatening to extinguish hers. 

the girl is eclipsed by the mind of creation
the girl's apotheosis comes about as a consequence of the demon's assault on her mind, provoking the seizure of her psychic potential and opening of her mind to the threshold in search of a way to escape her tormentor. in the process she discovers that the demon is a fallen angel of the mind of creation -- in essence the god. the demon confronting the girl is, to her naked psyche, a direct path to the god! she discovers that the god is apart from and yet a part of everyone; but in being part of everyone, the god is no one in particular. the mind that encompasses all souls did not have a soul of its own; the god is, in effect, a demon! 

the boy is created from the body and soul of the girl and the mind of creation
the identity that asserts itself in the girl's body accepted every aspect of her embodiment but one. by definition, the identity imposed upon the mind of creation was male. it takes little effort to modify the memories taken from the girl, who had been something of a tomboy, before adopting her personality as a boy. in a practical sense, the girl did it to herself in response to having her identity redefined by the experience. 

the man who was possessed by the demon that assaulted the girl adopted the boy and took him under his wing
it is possible that the man who adopted the boy had been the girl's biological father; the possability that he had not been identified or that the couple had been unable to acknowledge their relationship has previously been established. in the oldest version, the girl's mother was betrothed to a different man, and later versions she chose to become a courtesan to avoid that marriage, even though it prevented her from marrying the man she loved. his possession could have occurred during or leading up to the massacre. 

the girl dives through the mind of creation and then finds her way across the threshold
in spite of embracing the identity of god, part of her clung to her true identity, preserving her existence by using the vast intelligence she had embraced to recreate herself. the girl's psychic potential was enhanced profoundly as a result, though at first her use of it is unconscious. her return to the world came in response to her efforts to wake up from the horrible nightmare she seemed trapped in. the possability that the girl's mother was turned into a vampire during the massacre remains a viable way for the girl to lose her mother and yet still have her as an influence in her life. 

the boy grows up with a dark secret, turning into a girl once a month
the creation of his manhood came with an inherent curse, based as it was on familiarity, normally used by a demon in animal form to gain a human form while turning the infected human into a were familiar. in his own mind, it is an embarrassing mark of divinity, but it is also a constant reminder of who he really was and a challenge to the identity he had assumed. unfortunately, it is also a potential weakness his enemies could exploit. among them, all of the fallen. thus, when the moment of the mark's demise arrives, it is one of the fallen using the mark to mount its attack on the boy. coming as it does, when the boy is struggling with the desire to be a girl, an unconscious desire to return to being the girl, the demon is able to take possession of the boy's body to escape the slaying of the mark. 

the gods
the girl is not the first to embrace the mind of creation, and like her, those who have found themselves on the threshold with the option of harnessing the potential they realized in the experience and manifesting themselves. thus, there are those who were in a position to notice the girl's ascension, some of whom would seek to nurture the young goddess and some who would seek to exploit or even destroy her. by the same account, there would be those who would focus their attention on the boy, to see if he was the omni.    

a religion under seige
it was a time when the followers of the goddess faced persecution from the church of the one god. the followers of the goddess had hope, fueled by rumors that an avatar of the goddess was among them. after ten years, the girl those rumors spoke of was about to discover what she was -- and she was not prepared to face it. 

the academy, the art and beginning of the initiates' companionship
as the girl was confronted with her destiny, she was dealing with a completely different, but equally challenging revelation. the girl had fallen in love with a boy at a school founded to study and control rifts. an unintentional consequence of the use of magic was that it could tear holes in the fabric of space and time. within the rift, dreams and nightmares were reality. this dangerous phenomenon could be as small and subtle as a breeze -- and more devestating than the fiercest storm. 

the elementals, damned and divine
angels fall and become demons, spirits that impose themselves on the souls they prey on. most souls rebel against the identity forced upon them, so most demons are tormented souls, filled with pain and self-loathing, striking out at others like a wounded animal and driven in search of the soul that will bring them peace. 

a paladin of the goddess 
one demon found the peace of a soul's personifying embrace when a little girl sacrificed herself to save her father. ten years later, the girl must confront the consequences of her actions -- as well as a host of entities with designs upon her soul. once she begins confronting it, the girl would unravel the secrets of creation and face the prospect of becoming a god. it would only cost her identity. 

the guardian angel and the goddess
the demon within is a fallen angel of the mind of creation, and the source of the girl's connection to the absolute. through it, the girl touched the mind of creation, what monotheism defined as the god. in her possession, the demon once more became an angel, and when the girl embraced it fully, she was a goddess. to allow the girl to grow up, the goddess restored the girl to the realm, remaining apart from her as her guardian angel. 

the god and the demon of creation
in a sense, the demon of the realm is within everyone, but the girl actually connects to it and it pursues the possibility that she is the soul it has been looking for. 


..............................................................................................................................
human first incarnation - splintered realms

< previously mapped > reality splits into branches exploring every possibility but these splintered realms tend to flow along the same channels even in spite of profound differences. this premise is exploited to allow the male and female incarnations of a soul to confront each other. 

in one world he was conceived and born a boy
in one world she was conceived and born a girl
in all other respects, everything was the same until the night of the massacre
in both realms, they were confronted by their mother who was possessed by a demon assassin
each tore at the fabric of reality with his or her mind as the demon tried to rip out their soul

the girl hesitated on the brink of destroying her mother, taking possession of the demon to free her soul instead
she acted just in time to stop her father from slaying her mother
she managed a blind teleport within her realm taking her mother with her

the boy and his father were sucked into the rift opened by their combined attacks
they emerged in the girl's realm where she had weakened the fabric of reality during her own struggle
the girl's father was stunned by the arrival of the boy - rendered unconscious by his ordeal - and his father

with the help of "their" mentor, the boy's father figured out what had happened
the boy was traumatized by his role in the death of his mother
the boy was relieved to discover she had survived in this realm - and shocked to learn this reality's version of him was a girl

by the time the girl recovered from her trauma her parents had decided not to burden her with the full truth
the boy and his father were introduced to the girl as her cousin and uncle
she was told that the boy's mother had died in the massacre
in spite of her domination, the girl was not the only soul in the demon's sphere of influence
in the years to come, she would fall prey to captive souls challenging her dominion over the demon 

when the girl asserts her dominion, she is essentially a goddess - though she tends to repress the power, remaining a mere girl
the souls seeking to attain dominion tend to be dominated, resurrecting the demon until the girl reasserts her dominion
when the girl reasserts dominion over the demon, the soul is released from its influence and passes on
a soul in dominion over the demon is on equal footing with her; it's not within her power to disposses such a soul
this is one instance where she could be forced to sacrifice an incarnation of herself

< implications > the advantage of this approach is that it allows several threads used by the parents in other approaches to be used by the main character. the boy can become infected with familiarity by the girl during one of her possessions - or his mother at the time of the massacre. the mother can be involved with "twins". this approach also incorporates the themes and threads associated with the rift, including the exploration of the principles of space, time and mind as media with their own dimensions. 

< sticking point > the problem with the use of familiarity is that it goes both ways, meaning she would not really be forced to sacrifice her male incarnation. the alternative is to use the demonic ring for the boy's ordeal with turning female or to have him infected with familiarity by his mother before crossing the rift. the latter allows for his sacrifice to also create her "evil" twin and nemesis. in addition, the infection would put the boy in a situation where he must turn into a girl on brief occasions, often unwillingly. his curse and his awareness of the girl tempt and torment him, in keeping with the ordeal he faces while the girl struggles with the demon within her. an alternative would be for the girl to be eclipsed by the demon of the realm and manifest in a female form when she ascends. 


avon first incarnation - or the goddess of rebirth

child of a human mother and an avon sire, born and raised among humans
a soul claimed as the host of a fallen angel
a soul of creation, resurrecting the world of aeirn in the depths of the demon's mind
as the demon claims other souls, they seek refuge in her dream bringing news of the war
after the cataclysm the demon takes refuge on earth along with other survivors of the fall

human reincarnations

in the third age a man attempts to conceive an incarnation of the soul of creation
an angel of the soul of creation takes possession of the man, reincarnating him as the twin brother of a male incarnation of the soul of creation, then taking female form to conceinve a female incarnation of the soul of creation
this demonic incarnation ends when the children are seven, slain by demon hunters




20091010 - split incarnations of demon-familiar conception, separated at the time of the massacre...  

 her mother was a man infected with demonic familiarity by a possessed woman
  raped by the demon after they were both transformed
   ...stuck in female form until after the child was born
 her "father" pursued them
   ...confronting them when she was seven
	...taking possession of her mother when it was slain 
	...attempting to break the child to its will
 she took possession of the demon to free her mother's soul
   ...her mother had encountered the soul of the possessed woman during her brief possession
	...they shared her body until they could be divided
	...they found someone to split their forms among the healers treating the traumatized child
	...her parents decided it was best to divide the child to be raised separately as a girl and a boy
	...in spite of the division, each could still shift into an androgynous--and identical--angelic form
	...this alternate form was sexual, but neither male nor female--a trait of their "father's"
	...while dressed in this form, they can pass for boys, but naked they would be mistaken for flat-chested, athletic girls


20091011 - splinters of reality, the child is conceived as a boy in one splinter and as a girl in another and they meet as a consequence of crossing over... 

20081127 - <splinter incarnations, conception> the splinters of the boy and girl branched off at the moment of their conception as sexual opposites. events prior to that are identical, and differences between the splinter realities are primarily consequences of one being a boy and the other being a girl -- secondary branching is the consequence of natural fate and free will. the event that introduces the boy into the girl's world is paradoxical, a step across the threshold.  

20081127 - <splinter incarnations, conception> the critical event is the soul choosing to be male or female, a choice confronted in the moment of conception. assuming that the soul influences the process, starting with the genetic potential in the mother's egg and deciding what to be from among the options presented by the father's seed, morgan defined every attribute clearly, save for one -- sex. to resolve this, in one version of reality, he was born male, in another, she was born female. 

20090119 - <splinter incarnations, variant - orphan problem> the initial proposal for the splintered realms approach eliminated the girl's family ties. most of her family was slain in the massacre; but if the girl was the one to cross the threshold she would have to be severely traumatized to fail to recognize them when she arrived in the boy's realm. however, it presented the possability of her ability to rift walk being trained, providing a reasonable situation for her to return to her native realm to find out what happened to her and learn about her origins. 

20090119 - <splinter incarnations, variant - orphan problem averted> it is not the splintered realms approach that costs the girl her family ties; in fact, that is a pre-existing theme for the story. to accommodate the threads requiring the preservation of her family ties, the manner in which her childhood ordeal is handled must be modified. given that, the boy and his father cross over from a world where the demon possessed the boy's mother and was slain by the boy's father. this at least supports the idea of the boy being raised by his father and the girl's mother being involved with "twins". 



20091011 - staggered incarnations, a girl who is reincarnated as a boy after being eclipsed or vice versa... integrating the demon within thread, her possession establishes the girl's ability to change sex and her dispossession accounts for her reincarnation as the boy, who later manifests the ability to change sex

20091007 - different ideas have been explored to establish thread in which the girl is her own mother, from the creation of the embryo from scratch to the various child of fusion threads. one of the threads involved a forbidden conception between members of rival houses or bloodlines, an incestuous conception and a conception by rape.

20091011 - eve of paradox, a variation using a rift storm to loop twice; a ten year loop, she goes through at 7 and at 17... told from the older perspective, the girl does not know that her mentor and her mentor's daughter are different versions of herself. 

in the past she could confront her parents

parents and family
20081127 - in most approaches to this story, the protagonist's parents were prevented from having an open relationship. 

20081127 - in some versions, the girl's father was forced to marry a girl who seduced him and became pregnant. the first daughter was followed by another, two years later, and the two versions of the protagonist were conceived the following year. in other versions, this describes the family of her mother's brother-in-law. he was a recently widowed father of three, away on a mission in when his wife was slain. 

20081127 - <splinter incarnations> in the boy's version of reality, his father was able to claim him as his heir without identifying the boy's mother, and when he assumed his alternate's identity in the girl's realm, he again found a way to legitimize his son. the girl's father confronted the boy's father, and once he realized that the boy's father was a version of himself, he introduced him to the girl's mother. 

20081100 - <family> the girl's family consists of her grandmother, her uncle and his two daughters. the girl's mother was slain in the massacre along with her sister and a number of their peers. the girl was taken in and raised by her uncle, with her cousins, who were only a year and three years older than she was. through her mother, the girl was her grandmother's heir. 

20081100 - <family> the girl's unnamed father adopted the boy, declaring him courtesan-got to his mother and their extended clan. the boy was raised alone by his father as his heir. 











the familiar's ordeal
she quickly discovered the scope of the sacrifice her transformation imposed. to begin with, she had no choice but to assume the identity of the possessed girl. for all of her training, she had nothing to support and legitimize it if she tried to create a new identity. her options as a girl with no history or credentials were very slim. 

in order to gain shelter from her mother, she had made an appeal to be trained as a courtesan.  
while undergoing a crash course in her mother's trade when she revealed her true identity. 

she had continued with that training to justify her ongoing presence as a courtesan apprentice. while she was exploring her options, she caught the eye of a powerful, young noble who made arrangements, through her grandmother, to acquire her as his mistress. 

her grandmother set a trap to force her to accept the lord's patronage, binding her to him as his personal courtesan. by the time she realized what had happened, she was legally enslaved to him. 

her mother continued to help her adjust and adapt to her new life and circumstances. 
when she turned nineteen, she stumbled into the discovery that it was possible to change back into a man. 

if she succumbed to a powerful masculine or feminine impulse, she could turn male or female, respectively. 
it was difficult to control, since it required her to either indulge in or suppress a feeling that could originate from within or in response to outside stimulus. 

unfortunately, she accidentally betrayed her secret to the lord's wife. 
a practical woman, she simply took advantage of the situation to force her to serve as a male courtesan to her.
