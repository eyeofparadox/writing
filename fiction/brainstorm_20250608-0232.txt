set up as a place to work out ideas, new or old 


one idea that is inherent to the psychic model of paradox and specific to the modes of angelic or demonic psyches points to the manner in which an inspired mind can resonate with a particular soul. a contrast to the human experience, in which the foundation of a mind is a soul incarnated, the foundation of an angel or demon's mind is the mind of a host soul. specific to this point, angels and demons remain psychic dependents until they embrace their own souls. 

there is a broader spiritual contest that emerged from both nature and artifice. both evolved to encompass the abstract and compliment the manifest. this will need to be explored and incorporated into the greater work.

20090120 viable threads

the ideas that are being tapped for this project have been in development for decades and each concept has many variations. 

series 

:: major threads :: 

aeirn
perhaps the greatest oversight in the development of this project has been a tendency to overlook one of its earliest inspirations. aeirn began as the setting for a story in which, among other things, the male and female incarnations of the same person meet and merge into one. the mechanism for this was a manifestation of paradox, the rift. instead of pondering how those two ideas disintegrated, it is time to look at the ideas that have emerged to see how they are affected by the restoration of that inspiration. 

the rift
the rift is the manifestation of the shattering blow that splintered reality. the cataclysm and the creation of the rift have been tied together as the climax of the purge, a conflict among the gods that marks the end of the age of creation and the beginning of the age of ruin. in short, the demon that is the host of the realm was drawn into the conflict by the destruction of the soul that was its focus. 

splinters of reality 
the splintering of reality provides an explanation for the existence of different versions of the same people. in particular, it allows the vampire and were-tiger threads to be isolated yet based on the same character. it even works out that the game construct exploits the splintering of aeirn, which is potentially infinite, as if the splinters of reality were different servers. 

the gods, by chance and choice, were scattered among the splinter realms. they had the ability to cross the rift between splinter realms, and used it to hunt or hide from each other in the contest that followed the purge. 

it was always part of the initial inspiration for the boy to be a rift walker and the development of the story established a point where he and his father crossed over to a splinter of reality where he was born as a girl. initially set when the boy is seventeen, it also works to have the boy and his father to have crossed over when he is seven; the father ending up in a triangle relationship with the native version of himself and his lover. the girl's mother was originally depicted in such a relationship. 

demon within - a girl possessed and eclipsed by a demon 
this is the premise of the demon within thread in its mature form, the initial climax in the girl's story. the girl's childhood trauma has long been associated with the demon within thread and many approaches depend on this context. the details of her ordeal return to her as the demon strives to overcome her from within. this struggle for possession presents an opportunity for the boy to gain the girl's form by becoming a familiar -- it can also serve as a motive for immortals to cooperate to destroy her. 

a demon within - variant
one approach for establishing the demon within hails back to the war of the gods and incorporates the exile thread. the exile thread is the original inspiration for the demon within thread, featuring a demigod who was banished to the abyss, the deepest depths of the soul of creation. in the revision, he is not the only entity imprisoned there. the demon and the exile could actually have become trapped in the abyss together, the one used as a weapon against the other. in the original version, the exile was slain, hiss physical access to the realm destroyed, and its spirit bound or banished. 

in addressing the demon's origin, this approach would most likely involve the demon claiming a host soul originating in the realm of aegis. by claiming the soul of an outer god, the demon would have been marked in the eyes of the inner gods as a deadly threat. this alone is cause enough for it to be exiled to the abyss, but there was more. during the war of the gods, the demon collected souls aggressively, and those souls became trapped in a dream-like realm where they were immortal and had offspring who, by virtue of being born native to that realm, were mortal and helped to give the realm more reality. the aspects of both worlds are engraved in the host's mind, providing a template for the world within. 

a demon without
this variation of the demon within works with the thread where the girl takes possession of the demon she confronted during the massacre, turning it into her angel and saving her parents by turning them into vampires. the integration of the angel makes her an avatar of the goddess, bringing her to the attention of the demon of the realm. 

the demon originated in the domain of aegis and the souls it captured gave rise to the domain of aeirn in the demon's shadow. the point of collecting souls was to find a soul of its own; unfortunately, the demon was intent on assimilating the soul it sought, instead of allowing itself to be assimilated. the demon incorporated part of itself into the net, using the system to screen and harvest souls of the aegis. as players, souls of the aegis unwittingly created new incarnations of themselves into which they are drawn at death. 
 
the demon within thread is a key part of the story and is usually established in a childhood tragedy, at which time the girl managed to eclipse the demon attempting to possess her. it was always part of the girl's thread that she possessed and used her psychic potential to eclipse a demon, establishing the demon within thread. there are a number of explored options for defining the circumstances of her childhood trauma. 

the specific events need to be retailored to support the current version of the story; for example, some of the integrated threads feature a strong and persistent relationship between the girl and her mother but the usual foundation of the demon within thread is the massacre of her family. this is tentatively resolved by having the girl resurrect her parents as vampires -- which also serves to introduce her to the underworld they become part of. 

another option would be for the demon within to be a fragment of the demon of the realm, allowing her assimilation of that fragment to be a step toward assimilating the demon entirely, a credible threat -- and opportunity -- in the demon's point of view. 

what is certain is that the event happens when she is seven. when she is seventeen, she returns home and is forced to confront her childhood demons. in addition, the girlâ€™s ordeal triggers his; turning into a girl is his half of the demon within thread. 

the point of allowing the demon to take possession of the girl's body is that it allows the boy to be turned into a familiar, thus gaining the ability to assume the girl's form. the fact that being possessed can allow the girl to experience life in another realm, and thus a completely different environment, is a bonus. the method used to restore her to her proper self is a method that could be used to liberate aeirn from whatever intelligence had harnessed it to exploit it as a game. or, looked at from the other side of the threshold, it could arguably destroy the entire world. 

avatars
a significant amount of the avatars story arc fits directly into working designs, up to and including the possession and eclipse of the main character. 

a boy-turned-girl 
this thread has evolved as the complement of the demon within thread, exploring the boy's ordeal of gradually assimilating his female counterpart. 

her assimilation leaves the demon in possession of her body, until her body is slain and the demon takes possession of his body. another benefit is that the demon within and the demon of the realm are separate entities. the demon within would have originated in the mind of an eclipsed soul of the aegis and most likely would have fallen during the purge or the age of ruin. the world within this demon is still taking shape, inspired by the dreams and memories of souls native to both aeirn and the aegis. 

a girl confronts a boy bitten by the demon and turned into her twin 
the problem here is that this is essentially the establishing event in the demon familiar origin of a person who is divided into male and female incarnations; in order for this boy to be the girl's counterpart, something of this nature has to have already occurred. 

a girl helps the boy cope with being a girl 
this was an original main thread -- a boy-turned-girl -- and can be adapted to resolve a childhood division or merge two splinter incarnations. 

a boy-turned-girl is raped by the demon 
this is the crisis point of the conflict and the opening part of the climax of the demon within thread. as a singular duality origin, this rape would result in the conception of the main character. a conception under the present circumstances would be parthenogenic. 

slain lover

a boy-turned-girl slays the demon 
this is the turning point and escalation of the climax employing one of the oldest inspirations, the slain twin. when the boy-turned-girl slew the demon, its body automatically reverted to its original female form in a desperate attempt to repair itself but the demon was still impaled. 

a boy-turned-girl is possessed and eclipsed by the demon 
this is the revealed mechanism of the slain twin thread. as its host body died, the demon took possession of the only other body available, leaving the girl's corpse to be discovered. 

a boy-turned-girl crosses the threshold 
this element has been developed in several forms, each suitable for the main story line. the ordeal she goes through here is potentially a book in its own right. it can easily be developed as a sequel, however. the original demon within thread involved a struggle for dominance; the girl's possession is intermittent and the boy's transformation gives the demon a way to edge her out and force him to assimilate her. 

unpromised
even though there is an option to have the demon assimilated instantly, the experiences the main character has while eclipsed by the demon sheds light on how people from the realm of aegis gained access to the realm of aeirn. this allows most of the unpromised story arc to be resurrected, up to and including the preparation of the main character to confront the demon and face destruction. 

the unpromised arc initially featured background concerning her return home, an episode involving her education and household obligations passed on from her mother, who had fled from them. among the obligations she faces are the duties to her house and an arranged marriage. the boy to whom she has been engaged is the son of the man her mother was supposed to marry, a pact between houses that had been put off for a generation. 

accidental assassin
the girl fell in with the wrong crowd while growing up. her amazing agility earned her an unwilling, street-wise apprenticeship in cat burglary, disguised initially as training in gymnastics, acrobatics and fighting known as shadow-dancing. she does such a good job of obscuring her life as a thief that she somehow ends up with a reputation in the underworld as an unusually competent young assassin. 

threshold, eve of paradox
the follow-up to the unpromised arc is the threshold story arc, which is set up in the opening story. some characters and elements of the threshold can be introduced in the first book, along with characters and elements of the accidental assassin. 

 
loose threads & variations

the girl crosses the rift
it is possible that it was the girl who crossed over with her father following the death of her mother. her father was a rift walker, like his counterpart, and entered the rift to rescue his daughter when she fell into the rift to escape from the demon that was trying to possess her. this approach causes the girl's mother to be eclipsed and take on the role of the goddess of mystery in the unpromised thread. the girl's adversary is her mother's personal demon -- her own is currently in possession of her body. her mother's demon seeks to seduce her into embracing the demon within her. 

in her own world, the girl and her father were the only survivors of the massacre that wiped out their entire extended family. in part, it was having nothing to return to that compelled her father not to try finding their way back home. in both worlds, the mother was the protÃ©gÃ© of the father's mother. officially, the girl is an orphan and a protÃ©gÃ© of the boy's mother. her father was presented as his counterpart's twin, at his mother's insistence -- to claim the girl as her own heir. 

the other boy
the engagement the girl is thrust into does not need to involve her male incarnation; in fact, the engagement is a threat to her relationship with him, or more accurately, her relationship with him is seen as a threat to her engagement. the boy she is engaged to is actually a player character, as in the threshold thread. 

the boy the girl ends up engaged to was introduced through the game as an orphan. her father takes him on as his protÃ©gÃ© and heir to establish his own tradition in the art. he employed the art and the skills of an assassin as a hunter of immortals, and taught them to the boy. the boy took an interest in the girl when she became caught up in the world of assassins and immortals. 

this approach also lends itself to a version of the wager, involving her in events that lead up to the ruins becoming the site for the trials, through her helping to reveal what is lurking within them. it would involve her in events that end in her death -- or possession by her demon and complete assimilation by her other half, incorporating elements of his transformation. both of them endure a trial of transformation as she struggles with being infected with vampirism and animorphism, eclipsed by her demon, redeemed by her other half and finally merging with him. 

the cabal
originally envisioned as a group conspiring to raise a demon or god of death, it evolved into a faction of inner gods or lost souls collaborating in a plot conquer the demon of the realm. the cabal is a conspiracy of adversaries, each seeking to dominate and devour the demon in the hopes of becoming the soul of creation, each needing the help of others to make the demon vulnerable to such an assault. this makes for an unstable alliance of opportunistic rivals at best. they cooporate to create a situation to their advantage and then compete to exploit it.

20081231-1838 child of fusion

the child of fusion impulse can be established starting with a child of natural conception. under normal circumstances, the child would have been born a girl. the extraordinary aspect to the situation was the mother being possessed by the demon of creation early in her pregnancy. 

assuming that the story survives into the next generation, the child of fusion can establish the male and female incarnations without using a time-loop or reality-split, options that have been exhaustively explored without satisfaction. 

the most direct prompt for the motherâ€™s possession would be for her to be a reincarnation of the demonâ€™s focus. the most logical time for her possession to occurâ€”at seventeen, an age when she could reasonably be pregnantâ€”would be during an ordeal at the conclusion of her initiation. 

the childâ€™s embryo acted as a catalyst during the manifestation of familiarity between the demon and the father. the childâ€™s genome served as the template for a complex fusion of the parentsâ€™ combined genome. as humans with avon ancestry, the parents each carried the dormant genetic material necessary to resurrect the avon sex chromosome. the child manifested in the avon form, as the alternative to the male and female forms exchanged by familiarity. the demon escaped the consumption of the motherâ€™s body by taking possession of the fatherâ€™s body, which was also affected by the revised manifestation of familiarity. 

apart from being displaced and eclipsedâ€”a condition that places them among the inner godsâ€”the parents remain present, and normal.  


20081220 - key impulses

felicity: okay, here's what i remember (sorry i didn't get to it earlier!):

	in this world everyone has angels and demons as a part of their soul.

	gods are powerful beings who manifest angels and demons as other beings. 

	there is a girl and a boy who are actually alternate versions of themselves, but the boy is in the girl's world and eventually she has to take him on to save him as part of herself. 

	there's a struggle for identity. 

	she becomes powerful because of this. 

	there are vamp and were factions in the world. 

	because of her changing, both factions consider her on their side (however she is a vamp-that-is-not-a-vamp and a were-that-is-not-a-were) and want her support for things. there are magic users and psychics as two forms of power users.

	i also remember you talking ages ago about paladins.

does that help?

20081226 soul of creation - suspended impulses

they became involved in the climax of the purge
	she was marked for use as a weapon against the goddess
	he was used to deliver her to the cabal
	she was possessed by a demon who used her to get to the goddess

the demon expected the paladin of the goddess to be destroyed in its attack upon the goddess, so it maintained a link to its established host when it projected itself into the paladinâ€™s mind. once the demon possessed the paladin, it went dormant, leaving the impression that she had driven it out. it waited for her to go to the goddess, for the goddess to probe her mind for any lingering taint. to find the demon hidden in the depths of the paladinâ€™s mind the goddess would have to create an opening in her own mental defenses the demon could infiltrate. 

the demon had one critical advantage; the goddess had been its creator. 

the goddess had been identified as the soul of creation. the attack upon her was intended to awaken the mind of creation, or rather, to manifest the creator. the demon could not hope to possess the goddess, but it was capable of devouring her soul. instead of dominating the mind of the goddess, the demon set about tearing her mind apart from within, consuming the pieces until the soul within was naked. this was what would provoke the demon that had claimed her soul for its focus; the mind was what demon used to grasp a soul. without a mind, the soul slipped out of the demonâ€™s grasp. 

the goddess understood the implications of what was happening to her better than anyone. the threat of her destruction would cause her demon to descend upon her and retaliate with a power unlike anything imaginable. the dream she and her kind had woven into reality would be shattered. nothing mortal would survive. the only way to prevent that was for her to embrace annihilation. the only consolation was knowing that her naked soul would survive, through a scheme she had set in motion ages ago to create a brand new incarnation of herself. 

the goddess embraced the demon that was devouring her, possessing it and imparting it with two imperatives. one ensured her instantaneous annihilation, the other ensured that her soul would be passed on to the child of her paladin, whom she had already prepared to conceive a child with her true love. for an instant, the demon possessed her soul and was possessed by it. unable to stop itself, it thought the thought that turned that soul inside out and the part of the demonâ€™s mind that had been the goddess dissolved into a mist of incoherent information. 

they were at ground zero, cast in the rift on the eve of paradox 

in a realm where the child was conceived and born a girl, her fatherâ€™s identity was obscured

in a realm where the child was conceived and born a boy, his motherâ€™s identity was obscured

in a realm where the child was conceived and born able to turn into a girl or a boyâ€¦
	the woman was possessed by a demon and bit the man, making him its familiar
	the demon turned male and raped the familiar when he turned female
	the familiar mother inflicted a mortal wound on the demon father, forcing it to possess her
	the demon bore the child to be its familiar
	the child was conceived with the ability to turn into a girl or boy
	the child initially turned into a boy when touched by a male or into a girl when touched by a female

in each realm, the child was presented for initiation at the age of seven

the girl freed her mother from demonic possession by converting the demon into her angel
the girl resurrected her slain mother as a vampire
the vampire mother struggled to raise her daughter in the underworld
the vampire mother was forced to call upon her courtesan heritage to survive in the underworld

the man raised his son in the realm the boy tore through toâ€”the girlâ€™s realm
