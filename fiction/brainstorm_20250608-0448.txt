one idea that is inherent to the psychic model of paradox and specific to the modes of angelic or demonic psyches points to the manner in which an inspired mind can resonate with a particular soul. a contrast to the human experience, in which the foundation of a mind is a soul incarnated, the foundation of an angel or demon's mind is the mind of a host soul. specific to this point, angels and demons remain psychic dependents until they embrace their own souls.
