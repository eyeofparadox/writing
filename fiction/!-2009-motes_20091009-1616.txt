a simple scenario; the timeline starting with the girl and a version of the demon within requires her to be fully possessed in order to bite and infect one man (an intimate, gender dysphoric, friend) with familiarity, then requires her to sacrifice her body to save the soul of another man, and finally reqires her to confront her reincarnation as a boy... option: the plotline starts with the boy troubled by dreams of the girl's life and the manifestation of her form; the girl's story is told as he relives it; the boy's mother is the friend the girl infected with familiarity, and his father is the dragon, the former focus of the demon she took possession of to free his soul; the boy was conceived parthenogenically by the dragon, as a way to save her from the threat she faced as the goddess of the world within; the world is Earth, the world within is Aeirn, which includes the eye of paradox (derivitive of Nexus/the Threshold/the Rift)...  

On her reincarnation, "...but the thing is, you didn't die. You lost your body, yes; that became mine when you... when she freed my soul from the demon. I tried to repay that by giving her a new body, a new life. I was a little selfish, though, and things did not quite work out as planned. I chose to be your father, rather than your mother, so you were reincarnated as a boy. I guess, in a way, she never knew she was reborn; she could still be locked in a struggle with the demon, oblivious to passing time."

..............................................................................................................................
20090100 - <seed><childhood demons> The epic begins when the girl confronts the nightmare of her childhood -- the massacre -- and tries to discover who was behind it. 

20081100 - <family> The girl's family consists of her grandmother, her uncle and his two daughters. The girl's mother was slain in the massacre along with her sister-in-law and a number of their peers. The girl was taken in and raised by her uncle, with her cousins, who were only a year and three years older than she was. Through her mother, the girl was her grandmother's heir. The girl's unnamed father adopted the boy, declaring him courtesan-got to his wife and their extended clan. The boy was raised alone by his father as his heir. 

20081100 - <note><childhood trauma> In the weeks to come there are many flashback events. At the climax, the confrontation with the demon is relived, but prior to that the girl relives the deaths of her family and their allies over a series of episodes. 

20081210 - <seed><initiations> The integration of the accidental assassin and avatars threads is set beginning in the summer and fall of their admission into the Avon Tear Academy. 

20090100 - <pawns, survivors of the massacre> The boy and girl were valid targets of abduction, interrogation and assassination due to their survival of the massacre and recruitment into the institution that had been the target of the attack. In any case, their elders' adversaries would rather win them over to their side, and would be inclined to drive a wedge between the kids and their allies, mentors, parents and patrons.

20090100 - <pawns, survivors of the massacre> The girl was also a target of opportunity during any conflict involving her immortal underworld patrons. Her death could fuel the conflict, but it could just as easily inspire a formidable alliance. 

20081210 - <the mark> The preface to the accidental assassin is expanded to integrate with the unwanted admirer of the avatars thread. 

20090100 - <accidental assassin, a favor> The girl is asked to help a boy catch another girl he is obsessed with, unwittingly setting herself up to be mistaken for an assassin when she disengages and becomes intimately associated with a mark. <The mark is an adventurer who pursues her after learning of her childhood misadventure in the ruins and the underworld. The adventurer is typically presented as the boy's rival, and sometimes as the dragon -- an outworlder.>  

20090100 - <childhood demons, the demon within> There is a build up to the formulation of her investigation of the past... Her psychic potential had been unlocked when she took possession of a demon that had once been an angel of the goddess. It had turned her into an avatar of the goddess, and brought her to the attention of the demon of creation. The goddess had suppressed that part of her in order to allow her to grow up, but as she developed her psychic abilities, she stimulated this dormant part of her and gave the demon more access to her psyche. 

20090100 - <accidental assassin, a child in the underworld> The girl's mistaken identification as an assassin is based in part upon her past involvement in the underworld. As a child, she was seduced into the life of a cat burglar, but she obscured her activities well enough that some got the impression that she was being prepared for a career as an assassin. Those rumors, combined with attempts on her life and suspicious deaths associated with her, proved convincing to some members of the underworld.

20090100 - <childhood demons, rival immortals> As certain events brought long-buried memories <inhereited from the boy's personal demon> to the surface, the demon's influence increased. The memories were followed by nightmares and flashbacks that caused blackouts. During her blackouts <during the boy's monthly transformation into a girl>, the demon possessed her <the boy's female aspect> and baited immortals into attacking her. The demon was laying a trap designed to provoke the full manifestation of her angel. As the immortals provoked by the demon began to attack her, she called instinctively upon the powers buried within her to defend herself. 

20090100 - <the tomboy> <An earlier option involved the demon-without taking possession of the girl and biting the boy, infecting him with familiarity. A few days passed before the girl found her way across the threshold to discover that the boy had transformed into her twin. In the working option (20090911), the boy was possessed by a demon as a child and bit his mother's female protege, and the damaged demon was able to assert itself only through the boy's female form. Regardless of how or when the boy becomes infected, his first conscious transformation into a girl was witnessed by a couple of his friends, and a few days later she returned to the city where she was mistaken for the girl, who had resurfaced during his absence. Like her, the boy and his rival -- a boy the girl had been betrothed to -- were marked for assassination. Because of her underworld involvement, some were beginning to suspect that the girl was their assassin. 

20090100 - <the girl investigates, the tomboy dates> Since the boy had become her duplicate, and wanted to keep his condition a secret, the girl had all the cover she needed to pursue her investigation deeper. Unfortunately, this meant that the tomboy had to put up with his rival's advances while posing as her. Strangely, the tomboy found those advances hard to resist. The girl's underworld patron, an ally in her investigation who knew she was no assassin, urged her to distance herself from her betrothed so the real assassin would not be compelled to silence her. 

20090100 - <childhood demons, probing the past> The attacks reminded her of the night of the massacre, leading her to suspect a connection. As she probed into the matter, an investigation conducted by the immortals played into the demon's hands. The immortals had evidence that she was provoking the attacks she was investigating, but could not fathom her motives. Had she intended to set off a war in the underworld? What they did know was that her investigation would lead back to them and their unwilling involvement in the massacre. 

20090100 - <rival immortals, participants in the massacre, patrons in the aftermath> The fact that the rival immortals participated in the massacre, willing or not, means that they were present and potential witnesses to the girl taking possession of the demon. This would radically alter the role they would play in following events. If they were present at the time the girl possessed the angel of the goddess, chances are they would have taken her and her mother under their protection <This would coincide with the thread in which the mother is turned into a vampire-were hybrid during the massacre, displacing the dragon bait thread>. Her later probing into the massacre would pose a potential risk of turning her against them, unless they could redirect her. 

20090100 - <rival immortals, redirection> Their contribution to the girl's quest would be assistance in identifying the people responsible for setting the demon on its path. The shift in circumstances encourages a change in the cause of the chaos in the underworld. An original approach put the cause on the same agencies responsible for sending the demon; it was an attempt to distract the immortals while demons, trapped in the ruins since the cataclysm, were freed from their ancient prisons. This fits a recent convergence of the cabal and the exiles. 

20090100 - <rival immortals, the experiment> The vampire and the were find themselves drawn to the girl, and see her influence over them as a sign that she is the demon. They are tempted to destroy her before she can completely enthrall them. As they get closer, they begin to suspect what she really is. To find out, they would have to risk killing her. 

20090100 - <an accidental assassin> As it happened, the real assassin was among those who suspected she had been contracted to eliminate the boy and his rival. Her own words and actions seemed to support the theory, at least, so the assassin held back to see how she would proceed. 

20090100 - <an accidental assassin> As things worked out, the death of the boy's rival was beautifully executed, an accident that could not be disputed even when the boy was successfully resurrected by the goddess <there is an opening to have the boy's personal demon take possession of the mark and attack the girl in his body, prompting the demon to take possession of her>. The mark's death was a bit messy <it would be if she was slaying a demon> and landed her in prison <when the authorities finally caught up to her, after the closing of the loop> until her alibi proved to be ironclad. 

20090911 - <eve of paradox, tomboy, confronted by her demon> The demon goes to confront the tomboy after taking possession of the girl. The demon had been conceived in the denial of the boy's true identity, gaining the power to act independently from the demon the boy assimilated, and driven by his desire for a girl's life and experience so the demon targeted the girl to claim hers. Once it had, it returned to its source to be reunited with its creator. 

20090911 - <eve of paradox, displacement> The tomboy realized that the only way to free the girl was to embrace the demon, but the demon had been aware of the paradox involving the girl since the night of the massacre when it probed her mind. When the tomboy embraced it, the demon took them into the past and initiated her reincarnation, leaving the girl in possession of the tomboy's pregnant body. The girl's body was left in the possession of the mark, the adventurer the girl would be arrested for murdering. 


..............................................................................................................................
20090912 - <eve of paradox, living in the past> The girl arrives in the past on the eve of paradox with no idea how she got there. The last thing she can remember is slaying her attacker, a demon possessing the adventurer's body. She discovers she is in the past when she arrives home at the academy and encounters younger versions of the people she knew from the future. The only people who are the same to her are the immortals she was acquainted with to varying degrees.   

20090100 - <the angel's familiar, a vampire> The demon had been an angel once, and loved a man too deeply to let him die. Unfortunately, the angel's effort to save his life turned him into a vampire. 

20090100 - <the demon's familiar, a were tiger> The demon had claimed a dragon for its initial host, and the dragon's soul remained its focus when the dragon's body was destroyed. The loss of that form was a setback, which the demon overcame by possessing a tiger and claiming a human familiar. 

20090100 - <rival immortals, the ordeal> The two patron immortals would face opposition from their own kind, for bringing her among them, so a situation could arise where they are forced to reveal what she is and then prove it through the ordeal of hunger and thirst. By this point, she would have been forced to slay immortals to escape from traps that had been laid for her, so many immortals saw her as an enemy to be destroyed. 

20090100 - <avatar of the goddess> To survive their embrace, the girl must embrace the angel within her -- bringing herself to the attention of the god aspect of the goddess, the demon without. When the girl embraces the angel within her, the goddess decides it is time to recognize the girl as her avatar. 

20090100 - <unadapted, eclipsed, the demon without> The moment the demon's attention falls on her, it took possession of her body, eclipsing her mind. This places the girl in limbo where she confronted the lost souls and the goddess. The goddess confimed what her ordeal of hunger and thirst revealed, but knowing what happened the night of the massacre still did not tell her who was responsible. The goddess also revealed what it meant to possess one of her angels; the girl had become an avatar of the goddess. The goddess urged her to continue her hunt.  

20090100 - <the exile, an adversary> The exile considered psychic potential to be a measure of divinity, and this view left him with no prejudice against demons. As he saw it, demons were the missing part; combine a demon with the right soul and the result would be a god. The exile made a pact with the demons; he would find those souls and the demons would join his cause. Of course, to gain their freedom, the demons saw no reason to reject a soul just because it was not an ideal match. In exchange for the souls and freedom, the demons honored the pact. 

 
..............................................................................................................................
20081211 - <two incarnations> A variation worth exploring involves having the girl and the boy both experience a version of the massacre. The girl remains in her own version of reality and becomes the primary thread, while the boy crosses the threshold to her realm to escape the threat the girl managed to overcome.

20081127 - <three incarnations> Previously, threads tended to be absorbed by the parents that were intended for the main character. Among the options explored up to this point is a way to establish the main character as a boy and a girl in different splinters of reality, and a way for them to be eclipsed and fused through interaction with the demon of the realm. This allows many of those displaced threads to be restored to the main character. 

20081127 - <three incarnations> The child of fusion thread can be adapted to the splinter incarnations thread to produce a three incarnation scenario. The advantage of establishing the two versions of the main character in splinter realms and bringing them together for the ordeal of the child of fusion is that it restores the threads to the protagonist and provides coherent support for threads that might otherwise be discarded. 

20081127 - <three incarnations> As a consequence of combining the splinter incarnations and child of fusion threads, a new, third incarnation of the protagonist is created in a process the parent incarnations survive relatively unchanged. The boy crosses over to the girl's realm, they meet, fall in love, conceive a child, the girl is possessed, bites the boy, they become infected with familiarity, the child manifests and the demon takes possession of the boy. 

20081127 - <three incarnations> The child is a new incarnation of the protagonist, a version conceived in the union of two halves of one soul. Or, the embryo becomes the catalyst of their fusion and transformation into something new. 



..............................................................................................................................
20090119 - <the demon without> The revision of the demon within thread is also possible. Unable to master her from within, the demon enters the realm through her; taking possession of his body and causing their fusion by biting her. 

20090119 - <the demon without> The greatest simplification would be for the demon to attack while their minds are merged during a moment of intimacy. By coming to the girl's defense, the boy leaves his own body vulnerable to possession. This can be the time that the familiarty infection occurs, or it can occur afterwards, but in either case following the conception of their redoubt -- which acts as the catalyst of their fusion. 

20090119 - <the demon without> The demon within thread starts with the girl, but is based upon the psychic potential the boy also possesses, giving her the potential to touch the mind of creation and cross the threshold. A confrontation with a demon forced each of them to call upon that potential. 



..............................................................................................................................
20081127 - <splinter incarnations, conception> The splinters of the boy and girl branched off at the moment of their conception as sexual opposites. Events prior to that are identical, and differences between the splinter realities are primarily consequences of one being a boy and the other being a girl -- secondary branching is the consequence of natural fate and free will. The event that introduces the boy into the girl's world is paradoxical, a step across the threshold.  

20081127 - <splinter incarnations, conception> The critical event is the soul choosing to be male or female, a choice confronted in the moment of conception. Assuming that the soul influences the process, starting with the genetic potential in the mother's egg and deciding what to be from among the options presented by the father's seed, Morgan defined every attribute clearly, save for one -- sex. To resolve this, in one version of reality, he was born male, in another, she was born female. 



..............................................................................................................................
20090119 - <variant - orphan> The initial proposal for the splintered realms approach eliminated the girl's family ties. Most of her family was slain in the massacre; but if the girl was the one to cross the threshold she would have to be severely traumatized to fail to recognize them when she arrived in the boy's realm. However, it presented the possability of her ability to rift walk being trained, providing a reasonable situation for her to return to her native realm to find out what happened to her and learn about her origins. 

20090119 - <variant - orphan> It is not the splintered realms approach that costs the girl her family ties; in fact, that is a pre-existing theme for the story. To accommodate the threads requiring the preservation of her family ties, the manner in which her childhood ordeal is handled must be modified. Given that, the boy and his father cross over from a world where the demon possessed the boy's mother and was slain by the boy's father. This at least supports the idea of the boy being raised by his father and the girl's mother being involved with "twins". 



..............................................................................................................................
20081127 - <establishing the parents> In most approaches to this story, the protagonist's parents were prevented from having an open relationship. In the adopted version, the father had been forced to marry a girl who seduced him and became pregnant. The first daughter was followed by another, two years later, and the two versions of the protagonist were conceived the following year. 

20081127 - <splinter incarnations, family> In the boy's version of reality, his father was able to claim him as his heir without identifying the boy's mother, and when he assumed his alternate's identity in the girl's realm, he again found a way to legitimize his son. Being resurrected as a vampire allowed the girl's father to be with her mother, but he did not ignore his replacement. The girl's father confronted the boy's father, and once he realized that the boy's father was a version of himself, he introduced him to the girl's mother. 



..............................................................................................................................
20081127 - <the girl's obscured ordeal> During the massacre, the girl was confronted by a demon assassin -- her mother, possessed by a fallen angel. Her psychic potential manifested in response to the demon's attempt to penetrate her mind and harvest her soul. In the face of that threat, the girls' love for her mother caused her to assimilate the demon and free her mother from demonic possession. 



..............................................................................................................................
20081127 - <the consequences of the girl's actions> Unfortunately, the girl's parents had been mortally wounded, her father forced to fight her mother while she was possessed. The girl noticed that her blood healed their wounds, so she made them drink her blood hoping it would heal them inside and out -- unaware that she was resurrecting her parents as vampires. 

20081127 - <the girl's ordeal> Initially, the girl did not understand this. The person who rescued her found her sleeping between the cold, dead bodies of her parents and seperated her from them without waking her. When she did awake, she was told that her parents were dead. The people sent to recover their bodies assumed some predator -- or corpse dealer -- got to them first. 

20081127 - <the girl's ordeal> The girl, traumatized by the official deaths of her loved ones, blocked the event from her mind and remained in a state of shock for months. When she was ready to confront the past, the only clue to help unlock her memories was her discovery in the ruins, which she later explored whenever she could. 

20081127 - <the girl's ordeal> Her mother's protege became her mentor. A distant relative was named regent to the estate and title that fell to the orphaned girl. When her parents turned up among the vampires, it was assumed that they were turned by one of the vampires involved in the attack. As vampires, their living ties were severed, but the girl defied the customs of the living and dead to stay with them. 



..............................................................................................................................
20081127 - <the girl's ordeal, the hidden consequences of the girl's actions> Taking possession of the demon to free her mother made the girl the focus of an angel -- a personification of the goddess within her. It also made her the goddess of the demon's realm. 

20081129 - <the dragon within> Among the inhabitants of that realm were the souls harvested and eclipsed by the demon, beginning with its original focus. The demon's focus survived as the god in that realm, a soul of creation who was under seige by a number of eclipsed souls who coveted his position. The only way for him to survive abdicating that position was by trading places with a living host of the demon -- a position few held for very long. 

20081129 - <the dragon within> The demon's focus was not evil; he was just desparate to escape his situation and had to be ruthless in order to succeed and survive. His thread is an opportunity to exploit the conspiracy of the contest for dominon and separate it from the war -- or fall -- of the gods of Aeirn. Both conflicts can be influenced by the impact of reality upon ideality in a sphere of creation. 



..............................................................................................................................
20081127 - <the boy's obscured origin> When the boy was confronted by the demon posessing his mother, and the threat of having his soul devoured, his defiance caused him to break free from the assault, seizing potential the demon had stirred inside him and using it to tear himself from the fabric of reality to cross over to the girl's splinter of reality and escape. 



..............................................................................................................................
20081127 - <the consequences of the boy's actions> The boy, traumatized by the disruption of his mind, had no coherent memories of his past. The bits and peices were still there, attached to and providing a foundation for his personality, but the facts of his childhood were hard to retrieve and unreliable. He escaped from the ruins and ended up on the streets with no idea where to go or what to do. 

20081127 - <the boy's ordeal> The boy's father had been forced to slay his mother to stop the demon. Unwilling to sacrifice another loved one, he dove into the rift created by his son, hoping to rescue him. At first, he thought the boy had opened a simple tear in space, but once confronted with news of his own death, he realized that they were stranded in a different version of reality. 



..............................................................................................................................
20081127 - <the boy's ordeal, establishment> The boy was identified as a survivor of the massacre and placed in an orphanage when he was discovered living on the streets in the girl's realm. The boy's initial confrontation with the girl occurred as a result of being assigned to the same room -- a consequence of having the same name. Their time together was short; the girl was reclaimed by her mother's protege, acting as an agent of her house.  

20081127 - <the boy's ordeal, establishment> By the time the boy's father had found him and returned to the point where they had arrived in the girl's reality, the rift had sealed itself. The boy's father did the only thing he could, and sought out the native version of his mentor, the closest thing there was to an expert on rifts. With the original rift sealed, his mentor told him, it could take forever to find a way back. 

20081127 - <the boy's ordeal, establishment> His mentor helped the boy's father assume his native alternate's identity and introduce his son, taking advantage of the purge to provide an alternate identity for the boy's mother. It did not take long for the girl's father to confront the boy's father, and discover that the man was an alternate version of him -- and that the boy was a female version of his daughter. 

20081127 - <splinter incarnations, family> The girl's father invited the boy's father into a three-sided relationship with the girl's mother. The two men tried to keep the boy and girl from encountering each other, however -- unaware that they had met while they were both at the orphanage. Their objections could not be stated, however, when others proposed their engagement. 

20081127 - <splinter incarnations, family> When the boy and girl first met at the orphanage, they had no clue they were complements, but based on their resemblance they deduced that the must be distant cousins, as did many adults. Once identified, the boy and girl found themselves in rival houses. 



..............................................................................................................................
20081127 - <splinter incarnations, family, engagement> The idea of engaging the boy and girl was proposed by the boy's step-mother and the girl's regent, to resolve the inheritance question at the heart of their house rivalry; it did not matter which house held precedence if the heirs to both houses were married. 



..............................................................................................................................
20081127 - <splinter incarnations, initiation> The girl possessed natural telepathy and telekinesis. The boy possessed natural telepathy and teleportation. Their psychic ability brought them to the attention of the academy. The boy and girl were recruited and offered training and education in the psychic and magic arts that their parents were again in no position to object to. 

20081127 - <splinter incarnations, companionship> The boy and girl become friendly rivals, as part of the same group at their school. In time, they become more intimate in anticipation of their eventual union. 



..............................................................................................................................
20081100 - <arrival, visited by nightmares and blackouts> The girl spends a night plagued by nightmares on her arrival. The next morning, the boy arrives in time to save her from drowning in the bath during a blackout. 

20081100 - <nightmares, the massacre> The girl's nightmares were brought to the surface when she arrived at school where the massacre had occurred. The familiar surroundings stimulated her memory, erroding the mental blocks that protected her from her childhood trauma. 

20081100 - <blackouts, the focus> In addition to the nightmares, she occasionally fell prey to traumatic flashbacks, visions that caused her to black out and lose time. During her blackouts, the demon's focus was able to gain temporary possession of the girl's body. 

20081100 - <flashbacks, the ruins> While exploring the ruins under the academy, the girl found her way to the scene of her ordeal and began to relive it in greater detail. An approaching storm drove the girl and her friends underground, forcing her to confront traumatic memories of being lost in the ruins. The first time, near the end of the summer of her seventh year she fell down an airshaft into a flooded section of the ruins. The second time, several months later, she escaped into another section of the ruins and -- presumably -- witnessed the deaths of her parents. The girl suspected that worse things had also happened, but she had blocked out most of her memories of the massacre. 

20081127 - <splinter incarnations, family> When she announced her intention to marry the boy, his father told her of their origin on the other side of a rift. The boy she loved was an incarnation of herself born in another version of reality -- and she was carrying his child! 



..............................................................................................................................
20081100 - <optional & variant threads> As presented here, the girl is in an unstable state struggling with the spirit inside her. At times, she embraces it and becomes an angel. At other times, it tries to assert itself and she becomes a demon under its possession. In part, the demon can defy her possession by drawing on the souls in its dominion. The demon's focus, confronts her with her options; she must embrace not only the demon, but the souls in its domain, or become its next conquest. Either way, she would become a goddess, but it is a choice between being greatest or least of the gods of the demon's domain. 

20081100 - The girl was confronted with the world within her while eclipsed by the demon. The god of that realm confronted her with the truth of her situation. To become an angel, she had to accept the demon's spirit as her own. To become a goddess, she had to accept the demon's dominion as her own. 

20081100 - The unique advantage the girl has is the presence of a complementary incarnation of her as a boy. To offset his influence, the demon takes possession of his body, leaving him in possession of the girl's body in a position to absorb her psyche and become a single target for domination. At the same time, however, it makes itself vulnerable, putting itself in a position that would allow her to free the soul of its focus, its first conquest. 



..............................................................................................................................
20090121 - <the dragon within> the refinement of active threads has closed the opening for the demon within's focus, but a different possabilty surfaced. The option is based on the demon's focus having been a dragon. In short, the dragon attempts to use a dragon initiation to escape from the realm. The dragon enters the girl's dreams and uses her psychic potential to manifest itself in order to begin its hunt. The girl, pursued by the dragon and the demon, takes advantage of one to deal with the other. As a result, the dragon ends up devouring her original body -- and the option of manifesting either form. Under normal circumstances, the dragon would have reincarnated her, but as a product of being eclipsed by the demon god, she had effectively resurrected herself. 

20090121 - <the dragon within, option> the dragon initiation could result in a partial -- or selfless and unconscious -- assimilation of the demon of creation, converting it into her dragon. This dragon enters the world within her where the dragon aspect of sire dwells, while the conscious aspect enters the world without. It's an open door, other options or variations may yet emerge. A valid interpretation is that it counts as an unconscious embrace of the demon, making her dragon an angel of the demon's creator. At the least, her dragon would be a new incarnation of her in possession of an angel of the outer god. A contrast to the dragon that is the inner god. Yikes!

20090121 - <dragon-phoenix, dual eclipse> "I am you now. Another version of you, at least... I am in your domain. You are in mine. You are my goddess. I am your god." 



..............................................................................................................................
A variation on the child of fusion thread incorporating the threshold thread. 

..............................................................................................................................
20081100 - <threshold, child of fusion, soul of creation> If the parents cross the threshold and confront the demon externally in the domain, they would discover the demon was carrying their child -- and because the child's soul had embraced the demon, or at least part of the demon -- the goddess Aeai -- the child could potentially become the soul of creation. 

20081100 - <inspirations - threshold, soul of creation, embodiment> - The demon assumed that it could not be assimilated by a human mind, in spite of the fact that Aeai was incorporated as the child's angel when she was assimilated. 

20081100 - <inspirations - threshold, the goddess within> - The opening chapter in the story arc is the story of the assimilation of Aeai. As the part of the demon embraced by the child's soul, Aeai becomes self conscious as the mother of the first mortal incarnation of that soul, manifesting in the androgynous form abstracted from the two sexes her stolen body can assume -- the form of an angel. 

20081100 - <inspirations - threshold, child of fusion, soul of creation> - Aeai is assumed to be the demon when she is first confronted by the child's parents. When they realize that she is an incarnation of the goddess, their discovery is passed on to the lost souls and inner gods that conspired to summon the demon by their agents in the Academy. 

20081100 - <inspirations - threshold, fallen angel> - Aeai is also mistaken for a fallen angel by other fallen angels, fragments of the demon's psyche that had attached to stolen souls. On one hand, the lost souls and conspiring inner gods continue to pursue Aeai as the means to attack the demon, while on the other hand, Aeai is pursued by the fallen, demons of Aeirn, intent on forcing her into their ranks. 

20081100 - <inspirations - threshold, alies and adversaries> - The child's parents ally themselves with Aeai, helping to keep her adversaries from discovering her pregnancy or the true nature of her child. One way to discourage the cabal's interest in Aeai was to convince them that she was indeed a fallen angel. Unfortunately, this only encouraged the fallen to pursue the trio in order to recruit them into their web pacts and conspiracies. 

20081100 - <inspirations - threshold, the purge, a cabal plot> - The cabal eventually decides to test the theory of Aeai's fall, moving against her to see if she retains a tie to the demon that can be used to provoke it into asserting itself. When this plot succeeds in arousing the demon, it tears into the conspiritors and eventually confronts the child. Aeai summons the parents to the child's aid, but their intervention has an unintended consequence. 

20081100 - <inspirations - threshold, the purge, a childhood trauma> - The demon's fixation on the child gave the survivors of its rampage a chance to slay it. The slayers saw it as an opportunity to drive the demon into a weaker vessel, unaware that the demon had willingly possessed the child. When they struck, they forced Aeai to dive into the child after the demon. The demon, seeing Aeai as no threat, focused on devouring the child's psyche. 

20081100 - <inspirations - threshold, a childhood trauma, division> - Aeai drew on the child's soul to oppose the demon, eclipsing the demon while the demon eclipsed the child. The parents entered limbo to protect the child there. Each parent provided the child a different focus; torn on either side between the parents and cut through the middle by the angel and demon, the child's psyche split. 

20081100 - <inspirations - threshold, split and shattered> - The child was divided into male and female aspects and this had the unexpected benefit of shattering the demon's mind. Aeai remained in possession of the child's body while the boy and girl are led by their parents across the threshold. The traumatic ordeal leaves each child with shattered memories and peices of the shattered demon. 

20081100 - <inspirations - threshold, the demon within> - Aeai warned the parents that reuniting the two halves of the child would restore the demon, but in their divided state the boy and girl might assimilate the demon instead. They needed time to mature and become self-possessed before they could be reunited. The parents take on the roles of mother and father, taking the girl and boy respectively and going separate ways.
