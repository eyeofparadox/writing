Short Story Outline

Author's notes: This is the story of a person who has been possessed by a demon, and begins with the main character cast into a kind of limbo, a shifting wasteland of an endless nightmare. Told in the first person, the main character has no clear memory of who or what he or she was, or how she came to be in this situation. An encounter with a strange being allows the main character to begin to understand what has happened, and be brought to an oasis, a part of the nightmare that has become the home of the souls previously captured by the demon and a world they created within it.
