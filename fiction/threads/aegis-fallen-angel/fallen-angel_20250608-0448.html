found her brother sitting at the crest of the ridge bordering the
easternmost edge of their family's sprawling ranch. His disappearance
shortly after the world wide war warning had struck her as
unsurprising, and typically reckless. Granted, the shooting was still
a way off in interplanetary space, but it was just like him to want
to be as close to the action as he could get. Pausing to take in the

that expansion caused it to become the Interstellar Authority,&rdquo;
Rachel resumed. Finding herself a perch and settling down, she
continued, &ldquo;Due to the demands of exploring, regulating and
policing more and more territory between worlds, the IA eventually
became something of an extra-planetary nation, an independent entity
subsidized by a coalition of planetary governments.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

well, that police force grew into a full navy, with fleets stationed
at every major core world, task groups picketing most of the minor
ones, and light formations patrolling the trade routes alert for
ships in distress or outright piracy,&rdquo; Eric elaborated, still
keeping one eye on the sky. &ldquo;The same growth and expansion
forced them to invest heavily in the research and development of FTL
propulsion and communication, which pulled everything together into a
singular, coordinated body and allowed them to declare themselves the
first interstellar establishment.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

&ldquo;They certainly tried to avoid presenting themselves as an
empire, emphasizing their multi-national origins and presenting
themselves as the lynch pin for an alliance with the whole galaxy as
its inevitable scope of operations.&rdquo; He paused to clear his
throat before drawing the topic back to the situation at hand. &ldquo;To
ensure that it remained a largely uncontested power, or as they say,
to preempt the possibility of factionalism leading to interstellar
warfare, the Allied Establishment of Galactic Interstellar Space set
out to reestablish contact with the outer colonies, establish new
ties of alliance with their governments and bring their worlds firmly
into the fold.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

being relatively close to the core worlds, managed to become
established in its own right well before the arrival of the first FTL
ships. Since then, it's been a struggle for us to retain our
independence. Our tech base was two-hundred years behind that of the
AEGIS and our refusal to bow to the demands and conditions of
membership in the AEGIS resulted in a technological embargo designed
to force us into submission,&rdquo; Eric summarized bitterly. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

disasters,&rdquo; Eric countered. Taking a deep breath, he focused on
his initial point, &ldquo;Because of all of these things, it became
imperative for us to acquire more advanced technologies however we
could. The constant threat of assimilation forced us to invest as
heavily as possible in the construction of our defense fleet. It's
mostly composed of frigates and destroyers, with a few cruiser
divisions for muscle, and station-based fighter wings supported by
orbital missile and energy platforms. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

her. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

up against the best navy in the known galaxy,&rdquo; Rachel murmured
with a sense of anguish.</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT COLOR="#000000"><FONT FACE="Eras Light ITC, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=3>	&ldquo;It's
been pretty tame so far,&rdquo; Eric admitted with a hint of caution.
&ldquo;They're just past turn-around and are decelerating in-system.
Even with a QUAD, it takes hours for star ships to reach us from the
outer system,&rdquo; he reminded her. The Quantum Uniform
Acceleration Drive of the AEGIS ships enabled them to generate
virtually impossible rates of acceleration. Rachel did not really
understand how it worked, but what she had been told was that the
drive generated a field effect that induced motion through a peculiar
'deformation' of matter. However that worked, precisely, the process
distributed energy&mdash;which became vectored kinetic
energy&mdash;uniformly to every particle within the field of effect.
As a result, there were no negative inertial effects to compensate
for. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

Eric responded, knowing better than to try to explain his answer in
this case. &ldquo;They should be coming into range of the mid-system

installations guarding the extraction facilities and refineries of
the system's main asteroid belt. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

looked at him, biting her lip in anxiety. To an uninformed observer
like herself, it was difficult to interpret the tiny, distant
flickers of destruction. As the sun set and the stars came out, it
became even more difficult, but Eric provided commentary and somehow
she forgot that she was supposed to drag him back to shelter. It was
eerie, watching that silent display of fireworks, growing more and
more apprehensive as they grew larger and appreciably closer. From
the length of the engagement, Eric suspected that the system defense
forces&mdash;what there were of them&mdash;had gone out to meet the
invading ships. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

it was, that stolen ship was tremendously powerful to stand up to the
task force sent to recapture it, with only Mead's light units to
screen and reinforce it. Even that was not enough, however, as the
enemy closed in on the planet itself. The ships, so large in their
own right, yet so small on a stellar scale, could barely be seen as
they forced the defenders into a high orbital engagement. The slivers
and shards of metal Rachel could see with the naked eye were vessels
two to three kilometers long. The tiny lights darting between them
were missiles or fighters, and finally, some sound could be heard as
planet based fighters were deployed from widely scattered bases to
meet the enemy fighters descending upon them from the heavens. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

were drawn at once to the flaming star fighter. They watched in
horror, as it struggled desperately to maintain altitude with heat
warped and battle damaged wings. In a flash, it was past them,
hurtling dangerously low over the compound containing their home and
all of the ranch's support buildings. Weaving between towering trees

trees. The enemy fighter had cleared a path to its final resting
place, but Eric and Rachel were forced to land in a clearing a decent
hike from the wreck. They confirmed that the pilot had indeed dumped
any remaining fuel and ordinance just short of where he crashed. The
fuel had burned hot enough to char the native plants, but the
explosions from the ordinance had all but blown the fire out. Not
that a wildfire was the greatest threat they faced. Mead's natural
predators had no qualms about feasting on alien flesh, and on their
own hunting grounds they often needed to be reminded that humans were
dangerous prey to tangle with. Trudging carefully around dying flames
and through the blasted, blackened ashes the inferno had left behind,
brother and sister crept toward the downed fighter. To augment their
usual side arms, Rachel and Eric had brought along the rifles that
had been racked in their flyers. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

battle over Mead raged through the night and well into the next day.
Rachel continued to help the doctor watch over the injured pilot,
listening to the reports being broadcast over the planetary nets.
Once the fighting settled into orbital range of the planet, the
mystery ship had been identified as some kind of carrier built on a
super-dreadnought scale. The massive ship had assumed the brunt of
the planet's defense, but by itself proved unable to prevent the
other ships of the AEGIS Navy from landing ground assault forces and
air support to threaten the planetary command centers and major city
centers. These were met by conventional forces struggling to defend
their homeland from invasion using inferior arms and armor. By
morning, reports had come in announcing the capture of three major
cities, and nothing the army, navy or marines could do seemed likely
to prevent the capture of the planet's capital and strategic command
center. It was all the surviving MN ships could do, with the help of
the 'stolen' carrier, to prevent the AN ships from providing orbital
support for the invading forces. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

final blow came shortly after the fall of the capital that afternoon,
when the carrier at the heart of the dispute suddenly broke orbit and
headed out system, leaving both sides in the conflict confounded.
Eric argued that the ship was not abandoning them, but trying to lure
the enemy away from the planet or even out of the system entirely,
but as their father, Roark, observed, it could not undo what had been
already done. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

surviving ships of the MN were forced to surrender, once the local

that the government of Mead was responsible for the theft of the
ship, the AN had demanded it's immediate return and surrender. When
the government and military responded that they had been oblivious to
the initial theft, and innocent of any part in a conspiracy to
acquire or keep the vessel, the AEGIS forces declared that they would
continue their occupation of the system until a guilty party or
parties were turned over to them. Their obvious suspicion of
government or military complicity was underscored by the fact that
the stolen vessel had come to the defense of the Mead Navy
immediately after the lighter force was engaged by the AN. The Mead
Admiralty insisted that they had been just as surprised by the
intervention, asserting that they had engaged the AEGIS Navy purely
in self defense. More to the point, the captain of the ship in
question, and his crew, had all been in AEGIS uniform during all
their communications with the estranged carrier during the course of
the battle. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

All movement had to be declared and subjected to a scrutinizing

Roark Montgomery had predicted, the occupation of Mead signaled the
end of their homeworld's independence. Over the next few days, the
AEGIS marines would secure their foothold on the planet, preparing
the way for the politicians and bureaucrats of the AEGIS to come in

impressively tousled head of hair. &ldquo;What is it, Ray? You know I
didn't get much sleep last night,&rdquo; he complained with a
convincingly suppressed yawn. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

too long, Eric joined Rachel, the Lieutenant, and a handful of his
unit in the family room. While remaining polite and official, the
soldier interrogated the pair, who reconstructed the events of the
previous evening leading up to their visit to the crash site. From
that point, the story drifted ever so slightly from the facts. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

we arrived at the crash scene, everything was on fire,&rdquo; Eric
picked up, from Rachel's description of their flight and Eric's
suggestion that they investigate for survivors. &ldquo;From the
pattern of the blaze, I assumed that the pilot had attempted to dump
his fuel and ordinance prior to impact, but it was not enough I
guess. Shortly after the crash, the tanks for the maneuvering
thrusters blew. At that point it became impossible to approach the
craft without getting severely burned. Rachel's training to be a
doctor, so you can understand her inclination to take a chance on
rescuing the pilot, but...&rdquo; he shrugged, watching the soldiers
nod in understanding. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

bit her lip, hoping they would not challenge the story. She quickly
sketched out the rest of the details, concerning their return home,

the news. Neither of them lied, they just omitted the most crucial
details and filled in the gaps with leading comments. </FONT></FONT></FONT>

see. I appreciate your cooperation. I had hoped, given the call for
medical assistance, that you had managed to recover the pilot. As it
stands, your account is consistent with our own assessment of the
crash site. The pilot was evidently not able to egress the vehicle
prior to the combustion of its internal fuel cells, and with the
resultant explosion and fire, no human remains could be identified,&rdquo;
the Lieutenant told them coolly, but graciously. He stood up and
extended his hand to Eric, &ldquo;I wish to express the thanks of
AEGIS Navy and Marines for your efforts on behalf of one of our
pilots. The loss is tragic, but that's the nature of war.&rdquo;</FONT></FONT></FONT></P>
