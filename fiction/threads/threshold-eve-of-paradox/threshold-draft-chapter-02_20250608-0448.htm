<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Dusk
stared at Dawn for a moment, confused. His face went blank, as he searched
through his memory to find an explanation for her sudden fury. This was far
from the first time he had tripped on a detail he should have known. The
product of living life too fast, he warned himself. Dawn remained on her feet
fuming. As he reacquainted himself with precisely who she was, and what sort of
history they had, he felt an urge to bang his head on the table. Finally he
shook himself out of his daze. “I am sorry, Dawn. I didn’t mean… I just… It
slipped my mind. I was addressing the whole group. I wasn’t thinking about what
I was saying,” he apologized, his face wrenched between shock, horror,
embarrassment and pity. “Or, what you had said. You asked a legitimate
question. My fault for treating it as skepticism.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Dawn looked down for a moment. She
took a deep breath and returned to her seat, studying Dusk. He still had not
answered her first question, but she could guess what it was not. His strange
obsession no longer struck her as a touch romantic, inspired by his compassion
for her trauma. “So, what you mean is, this whole crusade isn’t for me?”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Dusk considered the question and
sighed. “Honestly, no.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Dawn suppressed a sigh and looked
away. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>One of his companions leaned over
and whispered. “Way to go. Idiot.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Dusk pushed him away and studied
Dawn silently while the conversation moved on to new topics. It occurred to
him, now that he had reviewed his history, that he would need her. He reached
out and touched her hand. She turned to look at him, anger still seething
behind her eyes. “Look. I am sorry,” he said, pausing as eyes turned to them.
“Maybe we should step outside. I need to explain myself, and this bunch of
jokers will probably mess it up. Please?”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>She looked ready to say no, or at
least kick him in the shin.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“If you really want to beat me up,
we should definitely step outside.” He grinned, and a moment later she relaxed.
With a nod, she stood up, slipping her hand from under his as carefully as one
might back out of a dragon’s lair. He clambered to his feet, warned his
companions not to follow, and led the way out of the inn. They continued up the
street a bit until they found some shade and a bench under a tree. Neither of
them felt like sitting down. “I know I acted like I completely forgot you
existed,” he began.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“Again,” she interrupted.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“Again. I imagine this will be a
hell of a beating.” He shrugged. “I know it’s been a couple of months, and I know
things got a little… odd… between us. But I didn’t forget you. I just got
absorbed in something else.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“Dusk. You don’t have to explain.”
She crossed her arms and turned slightly away from him. “You’re the only person
I know who can get lost in a closet. You walk around in a daze, and the world
only becomes real to you when you are solving some problem or fighting some
battle. Maybe it’s because you’re so gifted, I don’t really know. I forgive you
and I forgive you, and in the long run I am not doing you any favors. You keep
wandering through life like it’s some sort of game, and one of these days it’s
going to get you killed. Why should I go on encouraging it?”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“Dawn,” he stopped. What she just
said sent a cold chill through him. Made him think. He shook it off and tried
to focus on his excuse. “You’re right. I can’t argue with any of that, but
there is more to it. A few months ago I learned some things about demon nature
that were very disturbing. By themselves they are completely harmless. In fact
they are necessary, but the arcane arts use them, pervert them, to pervert the
natural order. They have abilities no mortal in this world possesses, and which
no mortal should have access to. You know how deadly they can be, but, I am
sorry, you don’t really know how dangerous they can be. There is no way you
could know.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“If I can’t possibly know this, how
is that you can?”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>It was a good point. Technically she
had the same training he had. Arguably, he couldn’t know as much as she did. Of
the three initiates in the past five hundred years, including himself, who
received instruction directly under the Magus, she had been the other two.
Better not to think about that. “I don’t know if I can explain it. All I can
say is I was in a unique position to learn it and there is no question in my
mind that everything I know about it is true. The point is, I got so absorbed
in it that it overwhelmed everything else.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Dawn considered that for a moment in
silence. “Maybe you should tell me something about what you learned then, if
it’s that important.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“It is. There are some things I
can’t explain, because they would not make any sense to you, but what I can say
is, if the demon threat is not eliminated, this entire world could cease to
exist.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“How can that be possible?”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“That’s the part I would have a hard
time explaining. Let me just say that there are powers that protect and nurture
this world, and there are powers that are completely indifferent to it. If the
nature of this world is exploited in a way that threatens the security of those
other powers, this entire world can be wiped out with a single command and the
powers that protect this world would be helpless to prevent it.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“What are you talking about? The old
gods?”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“Dawn, the old gods were toddlers
compared to the powers I am talking about. The only reason this world still
exists is because it is beneath their notice.” Dusk could not help glancing
around to make sure no one was in ear shot. “I can not convince anyone of this,
and I won’t try. What I can do is point out the obvious threat, and encourage
people to deal with it.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“No kidding. I am not sure I believe
it, but, setting that aside, how? How are we supposed to eliminate the threat
of demons. They’ve been loosed on this world over thousands of years, ever
since the Cataclysm. I doubt anyone even knows how many have been unleashed.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“That’s what I need to make people
start thinking about. The question is, will you be one of them?”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“I will need to think about it. I am
still wondering what will happen the next time I confront one.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Dusk sensed that there was more of a
confession in that than she had been comfortable making. She looked uneasy and
pale. “Fine. You think about it. I won’t mention it again until you have an
answer.” He reached out and offered his hand. “In the mean time, let’s sit
down, chat with our peers, and bolster our courage for the trials ahead.” Dawn
took his hand and let him lead her back to the inn. As they approached the
entrance, some of the initiates were coming out. Most of them were from the
group he had recruited, but one was a stranger. His friends were giving the
stranger directions, when they looked up and spotted Dusk and Dawn. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>They pointed at Dusk and approached
as a group.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Dusk stopped, Dawn at his side, as
the man stepped forward to present a letter. “What’s this?” he asked, holding
out his hand and studying the stranger.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“Message for The Dragon. These boys
say that is you.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Dusk examined the seal and said,
without looking away, “Dawn, go on in. I’ll join you as soon as I take care of
this. If I can.” Dawn opened her mouth to question, and he added. “If you want
time to make up your mind, you had best not get involved in this. I am sorry.”
Dawn studied the messenger, and the rest of Dusk’s companions before nodding
and excusing herself. Dusk waited until she was out of earshot then broke the
seal and read the message. After he had memorized the contents he tossed the
parchment aside. As it burst into flames and settled to the ground in ashes, he
looked at the messenger and asked, “You’re supposed to lead me to this
informant?”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“That is correct.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“Did he say why we need to meet on
the Threshold?”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“I believe he said it was a security
precaution.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>This reply disturbed Dusk. A few of
his friends turned to each other, muttering in disbelief. “Quiet. All of you.”
They stared at him, but fell silent. “Martin. You and Quail go to the hostel
and find my mentor. Tell him I was called away on house business. Cougar, go
inside and give Dawn my apologies for leaving. Then join the rest of us at the
Sanctuary. You have ten minutes before we depart from there.” Those three bowed
and departed. He returned his attention to the messenger. “We’ll escort you to
the Annex. Once we’re on the Threshold you can take the lead. The message did
not say anything about an escort, so if you don’t mind, my friends will be
coming along. Just in case.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span

flanked by his remaining companions and trailed by the messenger. They
proceeded in this fashion through the city, following the winding road as it
scaled the terraced valley. Cougar caught up to them as they were entering the
Sanctuary. Dusk waved him over and bent close to ask, “How did she take it?” If
at all possible he wanted to avoid offending his best asset twice in one
morning.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Dusk sighed and led the group into
the temple. They turned from the main hall down a corridor, past meditation
chambers and classrooms. The temple was many buildings, and gardens, united
under a common roof. They followed a route common for those interested in
touring the gardens at a pace which disguised their haste. Dusk, the most
familiar with the Sanctuary, played the role of guide, as he pointed out and
commented on various features and their history for the stranger among them.
They exited the gardens through the dormitory wing, housing for transients and
petitioners, met Martin and Quail, and continued through a door at the end of a
side passage. They found themselves in a gallery no one ever seemed to visit.
Dusk checked the room and headed to a curtained alcove. He walked into the
curtain and vanished. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Dawn
leaned against the wall, her mind open to pick up the presence of other minds.
Following Cougar had been simplicity itself. Once again, while hardly proud to
admit it, her unofficial apprenticeship in cat burglary had paid off. Of course
few second story man had the advantage of senses trained as hers were.
Combined, they had allowed her to pursue Dusk closely and remain undetected.
Unfortunately, he had some tricks up his sleeve too. One by one, the minds she
was tracking had blinked out of existence. She did not believe they had all just
jumped off the face of creation, and it was equally unlikely they just dropped
dead without a peep of distress. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span

style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>She itched to find out what had
happened, but did not want to rush into the room and find them all conspiring
together, under some cloak of psychic invisibility. She had to approach with
caution. Since she had witnessed the obfuscation, she did her best to replicate
it. Pulling in her thoughts and emotions, willing herself to total inner
silence, she struggled to make her presence non-existent. Like a ghost, she
crept around the corner and along the passage to the last door. If she had not
sensed the group of people walking through it, she might have overlooked it.
The door, like her, seemed to be doing its best at pretending to not be there.
She glared at it as if to say, “Yes you are!” while struggling not to think it.
<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span

style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Remarkably, her insistence seemed to
convince it, and she no longer had to concentrate on it to make it appear.
Carefully, she released the catch and cracked the door. Peering, bobbing to the
left and right to scan the room through the hairline opening, she confirmed
that there was no one in there. Easing the door wide, grateful of well oiled
hinges, she floated into the room. From what she could make out, it was a historical
gallery, featuring mostly paintings and small artifacts on pedestals. The only
other exit seemed to be an alcove at the back. She drifted down to it and
pulled the curtain back. It concealed a small alcove where two people, if they
were very intimate, might sit together. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>She stood back, allowing the curtain
to fall and her mind relax. She had not been joking when she said Dusk could
get lost in a closet, but she doubted even he could lose a whole group of
people in there. She would have turned and started a search of the other rooms
she had passed if she had not noticed a peculiar sensation from her hand. It
tingled from contact with the curtain. With much trepidation, she reached out
to touch the cloth again. For a second nothing happened, then her hand started
tingling again and she realized it had passed, somehow, into the fabric. She
straightened her arm, and it sank through the material up to her elbow, as
though she had stuck her arm into a water fall. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span

pulled her hand back.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Apart from the tingling, there
seemed to be no damage or disruption. She stared at the curtain warily for a
moment, then walked over to a pedestal. Carefully removing the artifact, some
sort of helmet, she picked the pedestal up and brought it over to the curtain.
Holding it like a battering ram she advanced. The curtain buckled like any
normal cloth would, but nothing else happened. She stretched a hand to touch
the fabric, and a moment later the cloth flowed around the pedestal, until it hung
as normal. Finally, she focused her mind on the impossible object. The pedestal
dropped from her numb hands and she reeled back. Instead of detecting fibers
woven into threads, her mind had touched an artifact of pure art, the likes of
which she had only sensed once. During one of her sessions with the Magus, he
had produced an artifact from the age of gods to illustrate the nature of the
first embodiment of magic. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Dawn stared at the curtain and
realized that it was in fact a camouflaged portal. In theory, none had survived
the Cataclysm, and most had been disrupted before that, during the war against
the gods. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Suddenly, she was completely
convinced about Dusk’s claims. His unerring and cautious route directly to this
portal advertised how familiar he was with it, and lent substance to his claim
of having learned things pertaining to the affairs of gods, and even creation
itself. She was torn between revealing this discovery to the Magus and finding
out precisely what Dusk knew about the greater threat to reality. Ultimately,
her curiosity forced her to grit her teeth and step into the portal. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>For a moment, her vision danced and
her flesh itched from the passage, then she recovered her senses and looked
around. She found herself in a strange, tall chamber similar to the gallery she
had just left. The walls and floor appeared to be made out of glass filled with
churning clouds. The vaulted ceiling was obscured by a haze of light. Around
her were free-floating portraits depicting various human attributes clearly
identified by inscribed placards that hovered beside them. At first she could
not make out the inscriptions, but as she looked the script blurred and
reformed in standard academic text. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

sight of a man who had not been there an instant before. “How can I be of assistance,

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span

Chosen of the Goddess.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

she collected her wits. She ran the exchange through her mind a couple of
times, until the information made sense. Questions formed faster than she could
follow them, but she reminded herself what brought her here, and that every
second she delayed she came closer to losing Dusk’s trail. Studying the guide
she ventured to ask, “You’re here to answer questions?”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span

style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“Thank you,” Dawn bowed and ran to
the end of the chamber. The chamber opened onto a balcony that seemed to hang
out into an abyss. She swallowed and looked around. The only thing on the balcony
besides herself was a large device unlike any coat of arms she had ever seen.
On a hunch, she concluded that it was some kind of artifact, like the portal.
Frowning, she looked back at the guide. “How does this thing work?” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span

style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“Goddess,” Dawn winced, then
flinched as she noticed a bird of flames circling lazily around her head. As
she reflexively waved it away, the bird veered off in a wider circuit. When she
waved at it some more, nothing happened, but when she looked at the guide to
ask a question, the bird darted over and began circling him. At the same time,
a halo of flames appeared around him. “What is going on?”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“You have selected me with your
sprite,” the guide responded laconically. He seemed impervious to the flames.
Dawn considered this and then shifted her attention to one of the portraits.
Dutifully, the phoenix darted over and perched on the top of the frame, setting
it alight.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“Strength,” the booming voice

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“It’s true. The gods are crazy,”
Dawn shook her head and forced herself to focus on the task at hand. This
place, whatever it was, operated by strange rules. If she stood around gaping
every time she tripped over one, she would never find Dusk. On the off chance
she had not tripped and knocked herself out, entering some bizarre dream, she
needed to pick up his trail. The phoenix had followed her gaze back to the
“access node” and lit it up by perching on it. Like the portraits, this device
had placards associated with it. As she read each one, the inscription blazed.
When the one reading “Exit” lit up, she shrugged and nodded.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“Confirmed,” the voice boomed.
Numbers started flashing in the corner of her vision, counting down from ten.
She was about to ask what that meant when the count reached zero and the world
turned inside out.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>She had been trained, when pursuing
a target through unfamiliar territory, to pause and search out landmarks the
instant her pursuit became disorienting. So, it was habit for her to turn
around and study the spot where she emerged before moving on. It was a balcony
similar to the one she had just left, with a slowly spinning orb hovering in
the center. It took her a moment to realize that it was a representation of her
own world, an irregular sphere with land and oceans conforming to the few maps
she had seen depicting the whole of Aeirn, wreathed in a tattered cloak of
clouds. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>She tried not to dwell on it and
followed the corridor leading away from the abyss. She immediately passed a
couple headed toward the balcony, and could not help gawking at their strange
appearance. Their clothing was scandalously cut from some alien material,
producing an outfit more sensual and revealing than unabashed nudity. Combined
with a physical beauty no mortal could possess, they seemed the very embodiment
of lust. Her mind strained to distinguish the male from the female, and she
walked on still wondering. The corridor spilled out into a grand mall that
stretched from horizon to horizon.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Spotting a group of individuals
loitering at the intersection, she steeled her nerve and asked if they had seen
Dusk, and his entourage, pass by. After giving a brief description of the
group, one of them nodded and pointed out which way they had gone. She could hear
them talking about her, referring to her as “the Phoenix” in excited tones, as
she ran off. She could not help taking in the sights as she searched for an
elevated perch from which to spot Dusk. It was not hard to imagine herself in
the home of the gods. Everything was built on an overwhelming scale, the
architecture summoned straight out of dreams. The phoenix attending her darted
inexhaustibly from point to point illuminating incredible wonders and flooding
her with a sea of information about each. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>She felt as if she was walking
through a marketplace that dealt in satisfying every whim, curiosity and
perversity of the human mind, as well as a host of inhuman interests she had
never even imagined. Unlike any market she had ever wandered, there seemed to
be nothing to cater to the basic needs. With the exception of sex. In the sea
of taunting lures to a legion of incomprehensible activities, there were no
food sellers, no water bearers or directions to where a person might relieve
herself. There were no hostelries or inns. The only commodity in great supply
was someone, something, or somewhere to fornicate. How, she wondered, in a
place where sexuality was so out in the open, did sex become embroidered with
such obviously lurid, gross and guilty trappings as she was seeing? Did the
gods, in their immense spirituality, focus on sex for it’s sheer carnality? The
only thing that competed with sex, for sheer volume of interest, was a thousand
variations of raw, unadulterated carnage and death. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>She was relieved that the object of
her search forced her to tune out the importunances of both. She continued on,
clambering up and down any obstacle which offered a place to perch and scan the
top of the crowd. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Finally, she spotted her quarry. He
was still in the middle of the group that had accompanied him, following the
strange messenger. Dropping down from the statue she had climbed, she sprinted
after them, dancing through the mass of strange beings thronging the avenue.
When she finally broke into the clear, Dusk and his friends were nowhere in
sight. She found herself in a huge plaza where people milled about in groups
preoccupied with their own business. When she approached one group to ask if
anyone had seen Dusk pass by, most of them just shrugged. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

studying her appearance. “Did you get stuck in character? Have you been playing

her head. “Never mind. Your AI obviously loves you and takes care of you, or
you would have lost your handle already. This guy you’re looking for, does he

text emerged in response to inquiries. Like the guide, they instructed her in bizarre
incantations that caused more words and images to flash before her eyes, which
she struggled to comprehend and use. She almost lost her water when selecting
“Information, Tutorial” summoned a demon that started pouring ideas into her
head like a fountain. After a moment she realized there was no trauma involved
in the process, just some queasy disorientation. When it was over, she suddenly
understood exactly what Dusk had meant when he called demons harmless in their
natural place, and how he had had information he could not explain about the
powers outside of their world. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Once they
cleared the Annex, Dusk had allowed the messenger to take the lead. Under other
circumstances, he would have enjoyed a visit to the Threshold. Ever since he
had been “recruited” to do security work for the government, he had been banned
from open access, leaving the game he had just left as his only outlet. He
remembered the confrontation with Dawn, with a smile. She was a perfect example
of just how sophisticated the game had become. It had been disturbing to hear
one of the constructs of the game criticizing him for not taking it more
seriously. The truth was, he took it far more seriously than anyone else.
Although he was ultimately responsible for creating it, it was really a product
of the Threshold. The more he worked with it, and the tool he had used to
create it, the more he understood the awesome potential of the Threshold
itself. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Until his generation, and the coming
of hackers like himself, the Threshold had simply been a communications
network. It had been created, by absolute luck and pure genius, to serve as a
real time communications link for interstellar civilization. It was that and
more. In addition to being a faster-than-light point-to-point interface, it had
possessed other, more valuable properties. In addition to transmitting
information from one node, or mote, to another, each node had the capacity to
store and process information. These properties had not been fully understood
when political pressure, and available technology, forced the creation of an
interstellar communications network. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Even though communications traffic
was completely unsecured using the network, general ignorance about the
technology and how it worked initially kept this from becoming a problem. The
agencies responsible for implementing the technology believed that standard
quarantine and encryption practices were sufficient to guarantee the integrity
of any systems utilizing to the network. Unfortunately, the key to the mystery
had been given, at a moderate retail price, to everyone. It did not take long
for a community of hackers to form, dedicated to probing the untapped potential
of the motes. Establishing that the motes possessed the properties of memory
and processing capacity, and discovering that those processors were every bit
as instantaneous as the point-to-point transmissions, or that the motes seemed
to have almost infinite storage capacity, the first entirely virtual computers
were designed. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Initially, the only security those
systems had was proprietary code and architecture. Building the virtual
machines involved the creation of customized maps to harnessed resources.
Custom machines meant custom programming and that led to a host of platforms
that were totally incompatible. Inevitably, modules were written to improve
connectivity and share resources. Soon enough, the computers were sophisticated
enough to normalize code through smart modules offering adaptive,
reverse-engineering code interpreters. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The Threshold had evolved as the
master construct incorporating all these exposed systems. Basically, the
network became <i>the</i> computer. That computer became the sole property of
those who knew how to exploit it best. At one point, that had been him. Like
most people who used the Threshold, he had relied on the sheer immensity of the
system to protect his own programs and data. Having grown up with the
Threshold, he had lived with it’s strengths and weaknesses. Until the game, his
pride and joy, fell prey to freakers and tweakers. Either he found a way to
create a secure environment on the Threshold, or he allowed the game to
dissolve into mindless chaos. Exploiting a property he discovered in the motes,
and his own brand of genius, he succeeded in creating both a secure environment
and a secure interface to preserve the integrity of the game. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>This accomplishment brought with it
its own kind of fame. The government, desperate for a safe, reliable way to
exploit the resources of the Threshold, was quick to seek him out. The government
was not the only organization who prized his talent. As much as these other
organizations desired to acquire him for their own schemes, they were even more
concerned with preventing the government from acquiring him. By rebuffing the
advances of these organizations he became the target of abduction and
assassination, and so did his friends and family. The government eventually
secured his services by providing protection for him, his friends and family.
He in turn provided the government with secure systems. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Unfortunately, one aspect of that
security had a flaw. That flaw only existed, and could be exploited from,
within the game. He had discovered it a few months ago and taken steps to deal
with it. He had believed no one else knew about it. Until the messenger
arrived. The threat he had hinted about to Dawn was very real. The government,
if it discovered the flaw, and its specific nature, had sufficient leverage to
force him to dissolve the game. That was the last thing he wanted. If the
person he was going to meet knew what he feared, the situation would become
more complicated. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The only thing he could do about it
at the moment, was follow the messenger and find out. When they reached their
destination, he discovered that he was not the only one, after all, who had
figured out how to secure access and resources. He was also surprised to
discover that the informant was someone he knew. In an environment where
everything was an illusion, people made their names, and reputations, by
creating and keeping a handle. The first thing to look at was his or her
sprite. No other appearances mattered. He hardly glanced at the grave looking,
little-boy, focusing on the black snake coiled around his wrist, and greeted
his old friend in familiar fashion.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

to wait and followed. As the door closed behind Dusk, Asp gestured for him to
take a seat. “Here’s the skinny. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Assassins Guild.” Dusk nodded. The Assassins Guild was a group of hackers who
tended to play exclusively “evil” characters in the game. Not a great deviation
from what they were in the real world. “A couple of months ago a rumor started
circling through the underworld. Something about a demon getting lose on the
Threshold and returning with, shall we say, proprietary government information.
Now, most players read the boards, and so talk was kept entirely in house. A
few weeks ago, some noob sold the story to some special interest group. They
started shopping around for a contractor willing to test this rumor, and
exploit it.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

know about the leak or the contract at first. What I knew was that this noob,
Mortis, recently joined the ranks and started his own little cell. You know
these punks. Everyone is out to make a name for himself. Anyway, I got fed up
with this little prick a couple of days ago and decided to teach him a lesson.
I dropped a worm on him that picked up his maps, then cleaned out his
resources. In the process I got his logs, bank accounts, and personal records.
That’s when I figured out the plot.” Asp picked up a book from the table beside
him. “This was in his archives.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the book. In this form it was entirely harmless. He called up a diagnostic
program to parse the encapsulated code, but, with a simple language module from
the game he could practically read it off the pages. It was not hard to see why
Asp insisted on meeting him outside of the game. His famous security had truly
been compromised now. “Well, this should make it easy to kill. How much do you

your worth, but honestly it’s worthless. According to his logs, they took the
program to the demonologist the rumors started with, and employed him to
incorporate the code in a demon. He scanned the text and then lectured them on
what a piece of crap it was. I swear, the characters in that game are so damn
sharp it’s a wonder they don’t actually know what they are. I would bet he
does. I wish I could tell you who the demonologist is, because that cat knows
too much about how the game works, and more than he should about our world.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

game, but it is not beyond the capabilities of an AI. All they need is access

game itself is more the creation of my AI than me.” Dusk shook his head. “So, I
assume the capsule for the actual worm was delivered, and probably destroyed in
the process of being incorporated in a demon.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

you can deduce its objectives and find some way to get ahead of it. Apart from
that, you know it’s there, you know what it wants. I’ll work on getting more information
out of that punk. I can’t be too obvious about helping you. It’s one thing to
fight amongst ourselves. Quite different if one of us betrays another. It’s
kind of a shame you just amped the game like that. I imagine you had a reason
for starting a new campaign when you did, but the timing is real bad. By
