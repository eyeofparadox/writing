style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Apparently,
the second group had returned from their search just as Dawn and Rain went
around the corner. The evidence of this presented itself in the form of Lion,
who came around the corner announcing that they were to rejoin the party and
help move the gear upstairs. He stopped short at the sight of them squatting
side by side, Dawn with her hand on Rain’s shoulder correcting her posture and
balance so she did not urinate on her own breeches. Pelted by rocks thrown by
the embarrassed young women, he raced back out of sight shouting apologies. He
was waiting for them when they came around the front a few moments later. Rain
stormed up, pounding on him as he retreated into the building. Dawn sighed and
followed. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>She could not help wondering what
effect Rain’s transformation would have on the relationship between the two
friends, as she watched them trade insults while they collected their gear. She
had a sneaking suspicion that Rain had not just been altered on the outside,
and Lion did not help matters by baiting the new made girl. She made a mental
note to bring it up the next time she could speak freely with Dusk.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>She quickly collected her gear and
joined the train headed upstairs. Thorn was describing the spot he had
selected, a set of apartments at the end of a short corridor. Two guards could
be posted where the residential wing branched off of the main upstairs
corridor. Two more could guard the single entrance to the sitting room where
their base camp would be. There was a hearth and enough wood to last them
through the night. Lion and Rain dropped their gear and took up posts at the
mouth of the corridor while the others made camp. Four bedrooms let off of that
common area, which offered some comfort and privacy for sleeping. All the
windows were shuttered and secured, and Thorn’s group had attempted to air the
beds, which seemed surprisingly intact for the passage of a decade. Dawn was
just grateful that this was no where near where she had slept as a child. No
one she knew had died in those beds. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>They cooked dinner over the hearth,
and drew lots while they ate to determine when each of them would take a turn
at the watch. Dusk traded watches with Silk so that he could join Dawn on her
watch, while Silk took the earlier watch with Akashi. Torrent had given Thorn
the early watch, taking the dead of night with Dusk and Dawn for himself. Fox
and River each took a room, and no one said anything when Dusk and Dawn took
the third, leaving the last for their leader. Torrent just gave them a warning
look before retiring to his room with a general advisement to the late watch to
get plenty of sleep. It was going to be a long night. Dusk and Dawn closed the
door behind them and slipped over to the bed. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“I don’t know if I can sleep in this
place,” Dawn announced, eyeing the bed warily. “If I did, the nightmares would
probably be horrendous. Should we just slip out now and search for our demon?”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“What if someone checks in on us
after we’re gone? You know they will start a search for us. If anyone gets
killed because we wandered off, we’ll fail the trials. That’s not that
important to me, except that I depend on my status in the game to influence
people in it. I once tried ignoring the context of the game to get things done
and ended up being opposed at every turn. That’s why I put up with all of that
marriage nonsense earlier, and the restrictions of the trials right now.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“And what about me?” Dawn could not
resist challenging. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“Oh, come on, Dawn. Didn’t we
already have this conversation?”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“Don’t get excited,” she turned away
and started removing her armor. “I don’t mean, are you ‘putting up’ with me. I
mean, now that I know the truth, how am I supposed to treat my own life? Should
the concerns of my House or my Goddess—since she’s really your slave—interfere
with what must be done to protect the world itself?” She hung her leathers on a
chair and returned to the bed in her shirt and breeches. “I mean, what happens
if we don’t stop this demon in time? What happens if we do?”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“I can’t imagine what you should do,
Dawn,” he sighed, loosening his armor and pulling it off a piece at a time.
“This is your world. The only world you’ve got. I don’t think it would be a
good idea for you to throw any of it away in a rush to confront disaster. For
now, the demon is contained. We have enough information about it that if it
moves into the open we can spot it and track it. As long as we can prevent it
from getting direct access to Phoenix, we have the advantage. We have time. If
we flush it out here, we come one step away from neutralizing it. The greatest
danger right now is if it figures out that we are on to it. To prevent that, we
have to carry on as normal.” Dusk finished stripping out of his armor. He sat
on the edge of the bed. “I know that your life has been turned upside down.
Once we deal with the demon, we both need to concentrate on how to deal with
what we’ve learned about each other, and how the people in our respective
worlds will react to these discoveries.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Dawn considered that as he slipped
between the sheets. Frowning to herself, she crawled into bed, frustrated by
the fact that she had no choice but to follow his lead. Especially since doing
so was, as she used to joke, the most reliable way to get lost. Of course,
since she had confronted him with the truth, he had proven to be very focused
and effective. “Was it always an act?” she asked impulsively.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“Was what always an act?”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“Your absent mindedness. Was that
just a way to cover up for your differences?” she propped herself up on an
elbow to study his face.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“Not entirely,” he shrugged. He sat
up and inquired, “Do you remember what I told you about time in the game?” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>She nodded. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“I took advantage of the capacity to
accelerate the game to help deal with the demon corruption problem. The basis
of the problem is the art of demonology. As we both know, the advances in art
brought on by the Magus led to the steady eradication of the dark arts and
those who practice them. I thought that by starting a new campaign, and forcing
all the players to start a new generation of characters, I could both hasten
the end of demonology and encourage the rise of demon hunters. To accomplish
this, the game was accelerated by a factor of fifty-thousand, instead of the
usual six. Twenty years passed in the four hours we were all logged in, during
which our characters were designed, born and developed in context to the game.
However well assisted, that much acceleration is hard for the mind to deal
with. For the most part, it was a blur in which things slowed down for an
instant here or there when we could make decisions or take actions to influence
the development of our characters. The process created rich, detailed histories
for us, but it’s more of an archive that exists to support our roles in the
game. Most people never fully assimilate all of that information.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“So, you don’t really remember our
past together. That wasn’t really you?” she could not help betraying her shock
and disappointment. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“Not entirely. The character a
person plays is designed to be compatible<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>with the player’s natural personality. You have to remember, this is
immersive role-playing, the constructs players inhabit have psychological
profiles of their own. I could sit back and let my AI run me through the game
and have to deal only with command decisions. You could say, my character has a
mind of his own, and I am more his soul, the motivating force. The more
immersed I become in this role, the more ‘self possessed’ I become.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span

style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“This is a lot closer to who I
really am than most of my previous characters. I am not trying to be someone
else. I suppose I am more interested in being somewhere else. The differences
are only those which make it possible for me to fit in here. The knowledge of
customs and history, the languages, the skills and abilities I need to function
in my chosen role, things like that.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span

style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Her thoughts were in chaos as she
struggled to grasp what this meant. The thing that screamed at the forefront of
her brain was that the person she was in bed with, whom she had spent the most
intimate moments of her life with, was a stranger. The boy she had loved, the
past they had shared, was a fiction. “You can remember me, everything we did
together, but none of it is quite real to you, is it? The truth is, you just
met me. Like, you met a character in a play or a history you knew by heart, but
I am a stranger to you.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

and gathered her things while he gawked and stammered questions that never took
full form. She remained silent until she was facing the door. Without turning
she addressed him, “I am sorry for pushing you… for presuming too much. I
understand now why you felt wrong about sleeping with me.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

behind her. She tried to slip out of the room, but he reached past her and
forced the door closed. “Dawn. What’s done is done. I understand.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

shoulders and turned him to face him. She refused to meet his eyes, tucking her
chin and looking away. “There isn’t anything else. There doesn’t need to be

more assurance than that. You can’t possibly know who someone else is, only
what you can see and touch and remember.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

members of the second watch had bedded down at the eighteenth hour and were
roused six hours later. Thorn informed them, as they gathered in the main room,
that there had been a steady stream of encounters while they slept. Demons and
undead had been drawn individually and in small groups to their presence. There
had been no massed assault, so the five on watch had been more than capable of
dealing with the threat. Only once had there been an attempt by the creatures
to scale the outer wall, and Akashi had picked them all off from above, firing
her bow from the sitting room windows as they approached. To prepare the second
group for what they would face, they were led to one of the other apartments
off the defensive corridor. The remains of undead were chopped and stacked on
the hearth, waiting to be added to the fire. Their attention was called to the
remains of the demons. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

had, and could manifest, their own forms. They were not just hungry shadows
limited to possessing the minds of the living. To manifest their true forms,
however, demons required a sacrifice. That sacrifice could be made at their
summoning, a soul loosed from its mortal vessel and seized by the demon. That
same sacrifice could also occur if the host a demon possessed was denied
sustenance. Instead of allowing the host to die, the demon consumed it from
within. It shattered the mind and seized the soul to warp the vessel into
something akin to its true form. While a demon’s true form might be hauntingly
beautiful, this process created horrors.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

softly, “is that they become anchored to the stolen soul. They’re almost
impossible to kill, but they can’t disengage fast enough to possess you if you
manage it.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

when they think of demons,” Dusk mused, crouching next to a corpse. “Twisted
parodies of humanity that enjoy pain as much as pleasure, immune to almost any
injury.” He knocked on one blackened head, satisfied by the hollow sound. If it
had an ounce of brains left, it would regenerate and continue its rampage. “I
assume your group made sure of these before you left them in here?” he
challenged, rising to his feet.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

burning out the brain. I tried to sear the spinal cord and primary branches.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

be tempted to reduce these entirely to ash, myself,” Dawn asserted. She
wondered how many of these embodied demons began as men and women wounded in
the Dream Gate Massacre. As a child she had no idea of the lengths a demon
would go to, to preserve a foothold in the flesh. That horror had been a later
discovery, and a feature of more than a few nightmares. After a last look at
the monstrous corpses, she grabbed Dusk and they went to the end of the
corridor to relieve Lion and Rain. She guessed they had done a lot of talking in
the past six hours, Rain slipped her hand into Lion’s as they returned down the
corridor. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

sitting room door, she turned to Dusk and confessed, “I thought I would be the
one person who could really understand what Rain is going through. But, I am
not seeing anything resembling my own experience. My other half freaked out
when he found himself in a female body, and he fought it until he was forced to
face the truth.” She did not need to explain what had brought her dual existence
to an end. Dusk had been there, helping her to deal with the crisis when she
and her other half discovered they had once been the same person. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Dawn. She is a girl created from the life and experiences of a boy,” Dusk
explained. He went on to confirm her suspicions that the gallery in the main
hall was a relic from before the creation of the Annex. Because the tools for
players to modify their characters had been found to work on the natives who
encountered them, they had been disabled and reestablished outside the main
construct. He never anticipated that the artifacts would survive and become
active again, but they had, and they functioned as they were designed to. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

allow people to explore life from different perspectives. Every human attribute
offers a range of perspectives, but people tend to focus more on the advantages
and disadvantages they confer. For example, a lot of guys I know tend to play
female characters in games to take advantage of lower mass, quicker responses
and greater endurance. This game took gender bending in gaming a step further.
It made it possible for players to fully explore life as the opposite sex, but
not everyone could handle it. Everything was experimental for new characters
and these devices allowed them to fine tune their constructs until they were
comfortable and compatible with the players’ personalities. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

note: Initial pre-readers expressed the opinion that they found the polysex
elements of the plots a detraction from the plot, and the progression of this
theme to the character Rain unnecessary. Others referred to the Author’s
exposure to Ranma ½ with predictable criticism. Although the premise of this
story actually predates the publication of Ranma ½, the popularity of the
series has cast more of a shadow on gender exploration than other works
exploring the unity and diversity of sex in the psyche. In spite of numerous
parallels that could be drawn between this story and other works, this project
was developed to this point without deviating from the original character and
plot sketches developed twenty years ago. Later influences did have some impact
in lending insight into the material and if the work is resumed, those
influences will not be dismissed. The decision to continue developing this
story, in this or another form, will depend on reader feedback from this
posting to Fanfiction.Net. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
