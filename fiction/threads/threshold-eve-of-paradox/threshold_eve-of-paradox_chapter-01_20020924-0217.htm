style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>The
chatter of rain tapping on the window and marching around on the roof should
have been lulling her to sleep. As tired as she was, she kept starting awake.
It must have been the wind, screeching and howling through the flailing
branches, pounding the shutters and doors open and closed. But this was not her
first stormy night at the manor. Once more she closed her eyes and tried to
ignore the clamor. Sure enough, they popped open again, fixing on the wall. For
a moment she watched the images painted by moonlight and rainwater on the wall
across from the window. At last she realized what was keeping her awake. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Voices.
Sitting up in bed, she concentrated on the drowned out sound.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“Dawn, go to sleep,” a weary voice
complained from the corner. “You’re keeping me awake.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“Quiet. You go to sleep,” she
snapped.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Echoes of conversation were coming
from the vent in the floor, she realized. She crawled out of bed, pulling her
mother’s shirt tight around her, and crouched down next to the heating vent.
The other girl sighed, and sat up to watch. Dawn ignored her and focused on
listening. After a moment, the girl flopped back, then burrowed deep under the
covers, pulling her pillow over her head. From what she could make out, Dawn
figured there must be a gathering going on downstairs. A gabble of words, she
could not make out what anyone was saying. Then, in the midst of the confusion,
one special voice. Her mother was back! The world spun and danced as she hurtled,
with the blind, effortless grace of childhood excitement, from the room. In a
flash she was perched on the balcony, watching a gathering of adults greeting
each other as more of them came in out of the rain. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>She resisted the urge to run to her
mother. All that would get her was a warm hug and an escort back to bed.
Instead, she peered through the railing that ringed the vaulted hall until the
gathering moved deeper into the manor. She crept after them on bare feet, as
silent as a shadow. As the adults gathered in the lounge area below, she
entered the upper level of the library, flitting through the stacks to another
balcony. Her mother, Ember, seemed to be the center of attention. Dawn watched
her, not really paying any attention to what was being said. She did not notice
when she dozed off, and was startled awake by a sudden commotion. While she
blinked and tried to get her bearings the men and women below were jumping to
their feet and drawing their swords. The terrible, chilling sound that woke her
was instantly familiar, the piercing screams of children. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Dawn had never heard them ring with
such terror before. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Note by note, those shrieking cries
choked and fell silent, before anyone could reach them. Her mother had leapt
across the tables in the lounge, launching herself over the heads of men and
women standing between her and the doors. Closed and barred though they were,
the doors exploded open under her mother’s glare as she led the charge back to
the main hall. Upstairs, Dawn ran after them, stopping only when she crashed
into the railing of the grand balcony. Standing there, she could see the
soldiers returning from the children’s rooms, blood dripping from their weapons
and clothes. They rushed into the hall and took up guard positions against the
lords and ladies of their own house. Those nobles looked on in horror,
paralyzed by shock, as more soldiers filed into the hall, dragging the bodies
of children they had been charged in the utmost to preserve. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>While Dawn stared in shock,
struggling to comprehend what she was seeing, the garrison started cutting down
the stunned nobles, forcing them to defend themselves. Though the nobles moved
at once to protect Ember, she charged forward recklessly to strike the traitors
down, her eyes darting from one child’s corpse to another, searching for her
daughter. From above, Dawn began to scream as grief overcame disbelief. Ember
snapped around, eyes drawn instantly to the sight of Dawn running for the
stairs towards her slain friends. Ember lurched to intercept her, narrowly
avoiding a decapitating stroke. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The nobles closed ranks as Ember ran
back toward Dawn. Catching her at the bottom of the stairs, Ember picked her
daughter up and hugged her close. In the same motion she whipped back around,
her eyes glued to the fight. One of the traitors went down and a cold, dark
shadow rippled from his dead form. It rushed across the gap and engulfed one of
the lords. The man shuddered, then turned and attacked the lord next to him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“Demons!” Ember shouted. “They’re
possessed by demons!” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>This started a retreat into the
depths of the mansion. They encountered more soldiers, part of the garrison
stationed in the ruins where the manor resided, who blanched in shock when the
nobles brandished their weapons at them. After a quick exchange it was
determined that these guards had not been relieved. They had remained at their
posts out back until drawn by the commotion in the manor. The news that the
garrison had been infiltrated by demons made them blanch again. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“They must have been summoned in the
barracks, where the men were sleeping,” Ember suggested, after hearing the
soldiers’ reports.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“Goddess. How do you fight an enemy
who attacks you through your own men?” cried one of the lords. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Another lord, the oldest, glared at
him and shook his head, “This must be how our armies were taken at the border.
Guard your thoughts, people, and don’t look them in the eye. Killing our men,
as much as we are forced to, won’t stop these things. It just drives them in
search of new hosts.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“Now how do we know who is possessed
and who isn’t”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“You’re going to have to trust your
instincts,” Ember shouted as the fighting surged forward and they became too
busy to argue. As opportunity allowed, they called upon the arts they had
mastered, fighting back with sorcery as well as swords. Dawn’s flesh started to
itch and sing as the presence of magic around her ripped across the surface of
her mind. Time started to come unglued, unraveling into a moment of
incomprehensible flux. Dawn buried her face in her mother’s bosom as Ember
called upon the powers she had mastered, as a priestess of the goddess, to bind
and banish the demons as fast as she could. The possessed redoubled their
efforts to get to Ember and Dawn with each of her mother’s triumphs. At some
point it became clear that new demons were being released into the fray.
Whoever had started this massacre was still active, adding fuel to the fire. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>One of the lords, a general who had
been courting Dawn’s mother, as well as serving as her right hand man, spotted
the author of the conflict, striding forth under the protection of his minions.
He had the black hair of the merchant class, which marked him equally as a
potential assassin or lord of the underworld. For the first time, the nobles of
the Phoenix House were able to take the offensive. They concentrated their
forces on the demonologist and his ring of protectors, and quickly overwhelmed
them. As soon as the man dropped lifeless to the floor, the surviving phoenixes
retreated and secured an area for Ember to continue her work. The general stood
watch beside her, holding onto Dawn. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>She was exhausted, but wide awake
with shock. Her eyes stared wide and unseeing until they fixed on a shadow
limping toward them from a darkened corridor. There was something wrong about
the way he moved, something mesmerizing in his presence. To her mind, raw from
the constant abrasion of combative sorcery, he seemed to resonate to a dark,
beautifully eerie song. Something inside her told her he was dead. He had been
dead for a long time. The song was holding him together, but the music was
unraveling. He stared past her, as if intentionally ignoring her. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Ember noticed Dawn’s fixation on the
shadows and peered in the direction her daughter was staring. Her gaze fell
into the stare the dead man had locked on her during his approach. Her mind was
drained by the hours of chanting to the goddess, and weaving sorcerous attacks
and defenses. Too late, she realized that the demonologist had been undead, and
that he had carried a demon<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>within him.
That demon leapt from his mind to hers, crushing the pitiful resistance her
exhausted mind tried to erect. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Dawn did not notice as Ember froze
behind her, then twitched once in aborted convulsion. Still staring at the thing
she was perfectly convinced was a monster, she felt a moment of relief when it
suddenly slouched and crumpled. The haunting music she imagined, to interpret
the forces that had animated it, faded, and the heavy, pulsing beat that had
driven it to destruction was all that remained. Her attention was finally drawn
to her mother when Ember stepped up to the general and laid her hand on his
arm. Dawn snapped out of her daze when she realized that they were the only
three left standing. The hall was littered with the dead and dying and the last
assailant lay kicking at the general’s feet. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“It’s over,” her mother said softly,
taking the sword from her lover’s hand. He blinked and scanned the room, unable
to believe the scope of the devastation. He turned back to Ember in time to see
her draw the sword back for a lightening strike. “You never stood a chance,”
she sneered, after striking his head from his shoulders. She watched his body
topple with a faintly interested expression, then tossed the sword to the side
and faced Dawn. “For a moment there, I was almost worried,” she said
conversationally. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“You killed him!” Dawn blurted,
completely dumbfounded.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“Well of course I killed him. I
killed everyone. Didn’t you notice?”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“You loved him!” Dawn argued, gasping
for breath and struggling to achieve coherent thought. Shock had pushed her
well beyond the limits of sanity, and thought came with great difficulty. It
all seemed absurd. Dream like. All of the details she had witnessed, and the
snatches of conversation she had overheard started to sort themselves out. Her
concentration was taxed by the deep, throbbing beat that now emanated from her
mother. Her mind struggled against the obvious. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“I loved him?” her mother frowned.
“What a ridiculous notion. I don’t even know him.” Ember bent over and studied
her. Straightening and putting her hands on her hips, she announced, “I suspect
you don’t understand what just happened here. I think that must be funny. I’ll
have to mention it to the master. I am sure he can tell me.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Dawn recoiled, struck by a sudden
comprehension. “You’re a demon.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“Correct.” The demon sighed and
examined Ember’s hands, “This is a nice vessel. I wonder if the master will let
me keep it.” Without warning, the demon reached out and caught Dawn by the arm,
just as she was about to dart away. “Hold on. You said this is your mother’s
body. That makes you the offshoot. If what they say about you is true, I should
examine you before I kill you. No point wasting a spare body, if it comes as
part of the package, right?” At the words “spare body” Dawn gasped and clenched
her eyes shut. The only advice she had heard about fighting demons had been not
to look them in the eye. She intended to follow it. “Smart. But not effective.
I only need eye contact to take you in the heat of combat. Since I don’t even
need to possess you for this…”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Dawn screamed as something cut into
her mind and disrupted her thoughts. There was nothing surreal about this
brutal invasion of her psyche. It entered her like a white hot nail driven
directly through her skull. Her thoughts and feelings twisted away from this
searing intrusion, baring layers of information she did not even know existed
within her. A second nail followed the first. Then a third, in time with the
menacing pulse that emanated from her mother. The first nail withdrew, having
drunk its fill of secrets, as the fourth punched into her. The horrible, alien
presence thrust mercilessly into the folds of her mind. A terrible cadence that
promised never to stop, probing deeper and deeper, while Dawn writhed in her
mother’s grip. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“Well! This is interesting,” the
demon chirped, as the rhythm paused.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>One of the lances in her mind
twisted, and something like a flash of lightening arced across her nerves.
Dawn’s eyes snapped open, burning with a terrified and dangerous light. “Get
out!” she growled suddenly, as something powerful flooded through her.
“GetoutgetoutgetOUT!” Her thoughts coiled and then ignited with a passion that
made her tremble. The air around her stirred, pulling at the garments of the
slain and whipping their hair as it picked up force. The hairs on Ember’s arms
suddenly stood on end, as the atmosphere around her thinned and became hard to
breathe. A strange rupture seemed to be forming around Ember’s body, as if she
stood at the mouth of an abyss. Unable to push the demon out of her mind, it
seemed Dawn was somehow warping space trying to push it out of her world.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“This is very interesting,” it
added, with growing excitement. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The breeze turned into a wind, as
the aperture continued to open, and the demon narrowed Ember’s eyes against it.
The demon ignored the blast, as air rushed to fill the peculiar void engulfing
Ember, exerting enough effort to anchor her vessel in normal space while
concentrating on what it had found in Dawn’s mind. Among the wounded, heads
turned to observe, commanded by demons curious to see what was happening.
Distracted from their efforts to repair the bodies they had stolen, they began
to pick themselves up and shamble over toward Ember and Dawn. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Dawn stared at Ember in growing
fury. With each twist and perversion of that alien presence in her mind, she
became more desperate. Her consciousness recoiled from every thrust, retreating
deeper and deeper into her own mind. As she descended, she tripped over and
grasped at the threads of her potential. Whatever her psyche could provide as a
weapon, she tried to turn against her assailant. Most of it danced past the
demon’s invading consciousness, spiraling out to feed the fury that engulfed
Dawn. Dust and debris lifted from ground, to become deadly shrapnel in the
growing tempest. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The possessed surrounding them
suddenly sensed the threat to their leader, and stumbled forward to disrupt
this unholy communion. The leader, finally grasping the kind of power the child
was tapping into, launched a direct attack, hoping to shut her down. Dawn
wailed in agony, curling into a tight ball in her mind. A thousand times worse
than the pain of the probing, Dawn reeled, losing touch with reality for a
moment. She balled herself up even tighter, pulling in everything she had been
throwing out. The tempest suddenly died as Dawn collected herself. Thinking
itself on the verge of success, the demon in Ember focused everything into one
last attack. The ball of untamed potential suddenly compressed to a point as
Dawn recognized the possibility of her death, and welcomed it. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>In the moment of clarity, Dawn
noticed the possessed all around her, hands and arms cruelly locked around her
and Ember as they tried to pull them apart. She refocused her eyes on Ember’s
face. The humanity that made it her mother’s was gone. All that remained was
the monster who took her mother’s place. “Go away,” she said. An irresistible
force seized Ember’s body and flung it away from Dawn. Ember was ripped out of
the clutches of the those around her, and smashed through the wall at the far
end of the hall. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Once Ember was out of her sight,
Dawn turned to look at the possessed clinging to her. It did not occur to her
that they had tried to separate Ember and Dawn, or that they inhabited the
bodies of people she knew. All Dawn could see was that they hurt her. She
decided to hurt them back. Holding nothing in reserve, she lashed out at them
with the only thing she had. Her mind. The delicate patterns of art and nature
she had interpreted as music now appeared as tangible and clear to her as
crystal. In each entity rang a single note that kept the whole design tuned and
coherent. It was simplicity itself to reach out, silence that key note, and
watch as the pattern shattered and unraveled. The physical consequence was
shocking. Her enemies fell, quite literally, apart. Dismembered by the
dissonance in the forces that defined them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>With calm, cool deliberation, Dawn
struck them down in turn. The demon, forcing Ember’s body to rise from the
rubble, paused at the sight. It watched this awesome demonstration of
destructive potential with fascination. Impressed, but conscious of its own
peril, it shifted its attention from what Dawn was doing to the girl herself.
The damage Ember’s body had sustained, smashing through a stone wall, was
sufficient to ensure that it could no longer serve as a vessel. There was no
reason to be destroyed along with it. Since it had already established contact
with the child’s mind, it simply had to flow from one vessel to the next. Dawn
could sense this, as the demon’s thoughts spilled through that connection, and
waited. Death being much preferable to possession, she was already studying her
own key note. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The demon forced Ember’s body to its
feet. “Take a good look at your future, child.” The demon smiled. “I have
already won.” The demon closed the distance on trembling legs, grinning as she
coughed up blood from ruptured organs. “Strong bones, but weak guts. I’ll have
to remember that. It probably runs in the family.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>With each step, Ember was racing
toward death. Some small corner of Dawn’s mind rejoiced that she would not have
to destroy her mother to force the demon’s hand. Only herself. Their eyes
remained locked as the demon advanced. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>A few steps away from Dawn, Ember’s
legs gave out, her body falling to its knees. “Tell me something,” the demon
began, panting for breath. Dawn, paying more attention to the demon’s presence
in her mind than in her mother, was not really listening. “All of these
people,” she coughed up another gout of blood, and struggled to fill her lungs.
“All of these people… died… to protect… you. And you…” the demon choked a
laugh, “plan to destroy your self.” It forced Ember’s body to crawl forward.
For a while, it could not make Ember speak. When it reached Dawn, it looked up,
gasping, and forced the question out, “Is that funny?”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The light was fading in Ember’s
eyes, and tears streamed silently down her face. Similar tears blurred Dawn’s
vision, but her attention was on the presence that was rushing in on her mind.
Poised to self destruct, her instincts screamed that timing was absolutely
critical. The demon poured into her, and Dawn reached to snuff out her own
light. To her astonishment, the presence, washing over her like a shadow,
twisted through a corner of her mind and vanished. Before reflex could cause
her to suicide, a voice rang in her mind, so loud it was nearly audible. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Dawn
lurched forward, sheets flying as she exploded into consciousness. Her heart
hammered in her chest and sweat soaked her hair and shirt to her body. Her eyes
darted wildly in the darkness, into which the horrible images of slaughter
quickly faded. For a moment, she feared the darkness, filled with the horrible
conviction that her vision had been obscured by possession. Her hands flew up
to cover her face, and found it wet with tears. In the dim light from the
porthole she could see these were not the hands of a child, elongated and
calloused by adolescence and training. The child, she remembered finally, had
been left in the past. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span

style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Dawn took long deep breaths to stop
her gasping and slow her heart. Her blood sang with adrenaline, pumped out to
fight her nightmare, so there was no chance of going back to sleep. Gentle
snoring from the bunk across from hers warned her that her mentor was still deep
asleep. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>In the dark, she searched with
nimble hands for her breeches, and slipped them on. She glided away from the
bed, collecting her cloak and boots from beside the door and slipped out of the
cabin she shared with her mentor, careful not to wake her. A lantern burned at
the foot of the hatch at the far end of the upper hold, lighting the way. She
stepped carefully between crates and pallets as she headed forward to the
ladder. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Scaling the ladder, she emerged from
the hatch on the main deck, just aft of the forecastle and midway to the main
mast. She turned toward the bow and climbed the port ladder to the forward
deck. She carefully dodged crew men as they darted amongst the rigging, and
made her way to the prow. As she settled into her familiar perch, she was
grateful that this was the last night of their voyage. It was frustrating
having nowhere to walk and clear her head. The captain had chewed her out for
pacing the deck every night, and banished her to the prow with firm
instructions on when she could be where. The simple version was, never in the
crew’s way. Desperate for something to occupy herself with, she had offered to
help the crew, but the captain had threatened to clap her in irons if she
mentioned it again. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>As she settled down, she wondered
about her nightmare. It was unusual for being the most accurate recapitulation
of the Dream Gate Massacre she had ever had. It was as if, after a decade of
elaboration, the most frightening permutation her mind could come up with was
the truth. She was half tempted to write it down while it was fresh in her
mind. All her life people had asked her to explain what had happened that
night. The first year, her mind had refused to consciously acknowledge that it
had happened at all, and by the time she could bring herself to talk about it,
her dreams had made the truth very hard to recall. Eventually, the event had
been reported fully by the investigators, after painful reconstruction. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span

think about something else.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>That was pretty hard, given where
the ship was headed. Her mentor was taking her to Dream Gate. All of the
initiates in her class were assembling there for the trials which would
complete their training. There was no point in arguing against it, so she had
not. She had simply bit her lip and prayed for dreamless sleep. As long as
nightmares were put into a separate category, her prayers had been answered. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Dawn sighed and climbed over the
railing. Just forward of the prow, she could straddle the bow spirit, or sit in
the catch net, and remain for the most part out from underfoot. She composed
her mind and began to meditate. It would keep her thoughts from straying into
dark corners and compensate a bit for lost sleep. She quickly fell into a light
trance in which the sun rose and the Phoenix Coast sailed into view. The
bucking of the ship as it cut through the waves kept her from sinking into a
heavier trance. She remained cradled in the catch net as the ship pulled into
the harbor at Dream Gate. As the ship sailed into port, she made her way back
down to her cabin in the upper hold, to inform her mentor they had arrived.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span

style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Her mentor took one look at her,
half drenched from the ship’s jousting with the ocean, and sighed. She filled
the basin and ordered Dawn to wash, while she rifled through the girl’s pack
for something halfway presentable. She laid out some clothing and collected
Dawn’s soaked and salt-crusted shirt and breeches with their laundry before
heading up to the deck. Dawn did the best she could with a soaked rag and
dutiful scrubbing, but it was no substitute for a bath. Once she was dressed,
and her pack reassembled, she joined her mentor above. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>She found Amber at the railing,
drinking in the sight of the city. It lay in a broad valley that sloped down
between the coastal cliffs to either side. The dawn light turned the faces of
the flanking cliffs into wings of fire. Wood trimmed and whitewashed stone
buildings climbed the valley walls, becoming finer and more impressive in their
architecture as they neared the tops of the cliffs and ridges. Tree lines
streets and courtyards spread a canopy of green between buildings, nursing blue
shadows in the white walled depths. The grand columns of the sanctuary at the
head of the valley were imitated throughout the city, making it all seem part
of the temple of the Goddess. Her birth place. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>It was
ironic. For half of her childhood, this had been the place she thought of as
home. It was true that most of that time she had been away, but it had been the
one place she always returned to. Of course, that was her life as a boy. As a
girl, she had known only the sanctuary and the mansion in the ruins outside of
the city. She had left when she was seven to begin her initiation and had not
been back since. No one who saw her now would recognize her. She was a
stranger. It was better that way. The past year had taught her that. What had
happened to her as a child, the consequences of which she had spent the past
year overcoming, was too much to explain to anyone. It was certainly not
something she wished to show anyone. Since people were unlikely to believe it
without seeing it, she was better off letting go of those old friendships. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

it, so well. She could close her eyes and walk from the port up to the ruins.
Not that she would ever want to. It was bad enough that she was back here
because she <i>had</i> to visit the ruins. It had been a great place for a boy
to run around with his friends, exploring. For her, it was a monument to the
most tragic and horrifying experience of her life. Now, it was the final
obstacle to overcome in her initiation. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

remained silent for a while, before muttering, “You’d think I’d be used to

the nightmares. I’ve sort of gotten used to them. After a while you learn not
to wake up screaming. Panting and sweating like a race horse, yes, but you keep
it from boiling out. I meant to say something about it earlier, then you told
me about the trials. I couldn’t bring it up after that. I was afraid you would

suspect you of cowardice, except when it comes to what people think of you.
Your nightmares are the scars of a great trauma. As you know, trauma scars,
physical or otherwise, are dangerous weaknesses in combat. They need to be
identified, repaired if possible, or compensated for through training. If you
had told me about it, we could have done something. I don’t know if we have

withdraw from the trials, are you?”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The note of alarm in Dawn’s voice
made Amber pause.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“Amber! You know what will happen if
I don’t pass the trials!”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“I know.” The older woman hung her
head thoughtfully. “I don’t know. I am not the one qualified to decide. You
need to be examined by your master. I would hate to see you forfeit your
initiation at this stage.” She resumed walking with more determination. “Don’t
mention this to anyone else. The last thing you need is for word to get back to
your regent. She can see to it that your examination takes long enough for you
to miss the trials completely.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“I understand.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The couple walked in silence all the
way to the hostel where they would stay through the trials. After checking in
and getting their room, Amber left Dawn to settle their gear while she sought
out the master. Once she was done, Dawn was free to roam the grounds and catch
up with her classmates. She thought she was the first of her group to arrive,
when a quick tour of the grounds turned up no familiar faces. There were a few
initiates present with other schools, but no one she had met. Finally, one of
them approached her. Not surprisingly, this stranger knew her. She was famous,
after all. Part of that was due to being the sole survivor of the Dream Gate
Massacre, but most of it was due to the fact that their masters always pointed
her out as a role model. Instead of answering his questions about the ruins,
and what it was like to face a demon, she interrupted him to ask if any of her
classmates had arrived. He asked around and came back to tell her that a group
of students had gone down to the nearby inn, and that Dusk was among them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>That was welcome news. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Dawn had not seen Dusk for a few
months. She left a message for her mentor, explaining where she went and ran
down to the inn. It would be wonderful to see him again. A great deal had
changed since the last time they met. Most importantly, she had resolved the
problem that had stood between them for the last year. She was smiling and
humming to herself as she reached the inn and slowed her pace. She took a
moment to compose herself and slow her breathing. She was excited to see him
again, but she did not want him to know that. At least not until she saw his
reaction to seeing her. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>She focused her mind and invisible
fingers combed through her hair or smoothed and straightened her clothes. She
checked her appearance through the eyes of a couple pedestrians passing by, and
then stepped through the open door into the inn. As her eyes adjusted to the
cool, dim interior, she sought out the host. Spotting him she approached to
order a simple meal of bread, fruit and cheese to break her fast, with iced tea
sweetened by local honey. Watching as her order was filled, she fished a few
coins from her purse and laid them on the counter. She took her plate and cup,
heading toward a corner table. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Her path took her past the table
where the initiates from the hostel were seated, and too absorbed in their own
conversation to have noticed her entrance. As she approached, she was able to
pick their voices out from the confusion of table talk surrounding them and
make out the topic of their discussion. She almost turned on her heel and
walked out. Unfortunately, before she could, she was spotted by one of her
classmates who broke off and waved her over to the table. She sighed under her
breath and plastered a smile on her face as she reached the table and settled
into the spot they vacated for her on the nearest bench. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“We were wondering when you would
arrive, Dawn.” The initiate who waved her over quickly introduced her to the
students she didn’t know, and she greeted the rest in her normal fashion, a nod
and a smile. To her disappointment, Dusk, who had remained silent, jerked his
head up a notch in greeting and returned, impatiently, to the argument she had
interrupted. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“No,” Dusk said, turning back to the
person he had been addressing, “Demons aren’t the real threat. That’s not the
point. Swords kill people all the time, and whenever some idiot starts crying
that all swords should be destroyed, everyone laughs at them. The point is that
demons, like swords, are dangerous weapons that spend most of their time safely
sheathed and bound. The only time a sword is a threat is when it is brought out
and pointed a someone. People who ignore it get killed. What you don’t seem to
understand is, the instant a demon manifests in this world, it is a drawn
weapon in the hands of a dangerous enemy.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“But,” the boy retorted, “You were
just talking about how demons are part of the natural order, like lions and
dragons. We hunt those when necessary, but we don’t talk about wiping them from
the face of creation.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“Oh, be honest. You just don’t want
to be the one who has to deal with them. You want to be a proud noble warrior
and leave the dirty work of killing these monsters to crazy people like me who
just want to wipe them out. Wake up,” Dusk growled. “Demons are part of the
natural order, but they are not living things, like lions and dragons. Crystal
said that and she’s wrong. Demons, such as we are here to hunt, are deadly
weapons that feed on life for power. The people who wield those weapons are the
real threat, but unless we destroy the weapons they wield, deny them that
power, we can never draw them out where we can deal with them directly.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“I can’t argue with that,” another
boy said. “The thing I can’t believe is that you intend to devote your entire
career to this. Worse, you’re trying to get us to do the same!” He shook his
head. “There are hundreds, thousands, of threats that are equally dangerous.
What about the undead? In terms of capability and threat, they are the equals
of demons. Should we ignore them to focus on your demons?”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“Why are we arguing about this,”
Crystal demanded. “We should just follow our training. To protect our
communities, to respond to the threats that appear, whatever they may be, and
pass on the legacies of our birth and training. Where do you get off trying to
start a crusade, Dusk?”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Dawn found herself looking between
Dusk and Crystal. She frowned. She had known Dusk for most of her life. Though
they had separate mentors, they trained under the same instructors, all under
one master, and at one point had even been betrothed to each other. Like her,
his training had focused on answering the threats of the damned arcane arts,
but he had never shown a particular interest in hunting demons. “Where did you
even get the idea?” she asked, settling her gaze on Dusk.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Dusk stared at her a moment, then
scanned the crowd before throwing up his hands. By chance, he stopped eye to
eye with Dawn. “This is impossible. None of you understand how dangerous demons
really are.” He failed to notice as Dawn’s face paled and her right eye began
to twitch. “That’s fine. We’ll see what you all think after the trials. Months
from now, when you wake up every night, from nightmares about demons, maybe
you’ll think about what I said. You will hear reports of a demon haunting a
town on the other side of the continent and kill your horse trying to reach it
and kill it before its influence can spread.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Dawn had risen to her feet, her
breath suddenly coming hot and heavy. Dusk looked up into her withering glare
in shock. “You arrogant, stupid…! How <i>dare</i> you say that to me!?”<o:p></o:p></span></p>
