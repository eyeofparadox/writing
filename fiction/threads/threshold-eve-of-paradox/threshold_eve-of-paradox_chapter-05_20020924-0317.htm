"MS Mincho"'>Dawn maintained her level glare as she waited for him to respond.
He was at a complete loss. The accusation still rang in his ears. It cut him to
the quick. He just stared at her, standing tall and proud, stark naked, with
her gorgeous red hair spilling over her shoulders. Her eyes, normally an
impenetrable grey mist, were a brilliant emerald green. The way her breasts
gently heaved with each breath, and the muscles of her legs and belly tensed as
she unconsciously adjusted her balance, sent stabs of desire through him. The
memory of her blood, spilling hot and viscous over his hands as he held her
injured body, screamed in support of her <i>reality</i>. His fingers clenched
the sheet on the bed, the friction of the movement revealing the fine weave of
the fabric. The sweat that popped out on his brow trickled down the side of his
face. Through it all, he struggled with himself. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-fareast-font-family:
"MS Mincho"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The illusion was
so perfect. For the first time he forced himself to confront what he had caused
to be created. He had set an intelligence with access to unlimited resources
the task of simulating reality to the finest detail. His AI had no concept of
limits, except those that were imposed on her. He never really asked how far
she had gone to fulfill his instruction. He knew that this world was ultimately
just information, art imitating life. At the same time, he had grown up taught
that the universe he lived in was mostly empty space in which a vast web of
matter and energy was woven together in complex patterns. What were those
patterns, ultimately, but information stored in the medium of time and space?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-fareast-font-family:
"MS Mincho"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>As he continued
staring, immobile, her expression began to change to worry. She approached him
cautiously, reaching out. “Dusk? Are you going to answer me? Are you going to
say <i>anything?</i>”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-fareast-font-family:
"MS Mincho"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Dusk turned to
track her as she came forward. His mind was elsewhere, racing through the
archives where he stored game related code, searching for the architecture that
defined the minds of the game’s native inhabitants. Desperate to find out how a
construct had performed such a <i>subjective </i>analysis of him. Finding it,
he took it apart, trying to determine how the personality and intellect of each
entity was cultivated. What he found made him pale. The annotations Phoenix had
made were unbelievably detailed, referring to entire realms of psychology and
neuro-linguistic programming. The only constructs Phoenix had created, the only
hard code involved, was the simulation of organic chemistry. The game created
body-brain constructs, the physiological tools and an interactive environment
with which the nodes, captured to operate those constructs, programmed
themselves through experience. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-fareast-font-family:
"MS Mincho"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>He was staring at
a perfect imitation of a living woman, but the <i>person</i> who inhabited that
body was in no way artificial. Phoenix had provided all the resources for her
to become a unique, self determined consciousness. She was <i>aware</i> of
herself. Aware of him, not as an interactive variable, but as a <i>person</i>.
His eyes lighted up with awe at the discovery. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-fareast-font-family:
"MS Mincho"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“Dusk! Say
something! You’re starting to scare me,” Dawn hesitated, not sure what to make
of his expression. She looked uncertain, worried and wary at the same time. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-fareast-font-family:
"MS Mincho"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“You’re <i>alive</i>,”
he gasped.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-fareast-font-family:
"MS Mincho"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Dawn’s eyes
widened in shock, and she stepped back. Thoughts flashed over her face as she
stared at him. Self conscious, angry, but angry with herself. Dusk stood up,
watching fear conquer her expression as she flinched. She knew exactly what he
was thinking. She anticipated his disbelief and dreaded his reaction to it. Why
would she do that unless…<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-fareast-font-family:
"MS Mincho"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“You <i>know</i>!”
he shouted in increasing shock. Asp’s warning rang in his ears, as he
confronted Dawn. From the look on her face, he did not need to spell out <i>what</i>
she knew. “How is that possible? How is <i>this</i>,” he pointed at her,
“possible?”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-fareast-font-family:
"MS Mincho"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“Oh, Goddess,”
she moaned, and sprinted from the room.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-fareast-font-family:
"MS Mincho"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Dusk launched
himself after her, but she knew the house far better. She darted and twisted
and leaped through doors and over obstacles Dusk could not help crashing into
as he tried to follow. He thought he had seen her panicked when she fought the
possessed on the beach. Never had he seen her in total rout like this. She paid
no heed to the servants as she streaked by in the nude. When her regent stepped
forward to cut her off, no doubt intending some rebuke for her lack of dress,
Dawn practically ran up one side of her and down the other. Dusk breezed by as
the older woman lurched against the wall in shock. As they reached the main
hall, Dawn flung herself off the balcony and glided to the main floor. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-fareast-font-family:
"MS Mincho"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Dusk was
surprised she was able to levitate at all, given her state of mind. Leaping
after her, he had to break his fall the hard way, collapsing as he hit and
rolling back to his feet. She burst out through the towering double doors of
the main entrance, and kept running into the evening light. She looked ready to
plough through the guardsmen, posted at the main gate to enforce her house
arrest, when she suddenly stumbled to a halt. People were spilling out of the
house in shock and curiosity, and the guards were advancing towards her,
alarmed by the panic still evident on her face. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-fareast-font-family:
"MS Mincho"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Dusk stopped a
few yards behind her. This was going to be a bit awkward. Dawn turned to look
at him, then just collapsed to her knees. He approached her carefully, speaking
as calmly as possible, “I am not angry, Dawn. Shocked. Amazed.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I can imagine what you are afraid of, but…
there’s no need to be afraid. At least, not of me. But we need to talk about
this. Privately.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-fareast-font-family:
"MS Mincho"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Crimson emerged
from the mansion and strode up to him, fuming. “What have you done to her,
Dusk! She was running from you!”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-fareast-font-family:
"MS Mincho"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Dusk winced and
turned to face her. Taking a deep breath, he said, “I just informed her of the
Goddess’s reply to my petition.” At that, Crimson drew back, curiosity and hope
in her eyes. From Dawn’s distress, she clearly assumed that the outburst was
for loosing her chance to complete the trials. “She said she could not bless
our union until I resolve my feelings for Dawn. Apparently,” he looked to Dawn,
speaking more for her, “I’ve never taken her seriously as a person. There are a
lot of things to figure out, and I am not entirely sure how to begin.” He kept
his eyes on her, waiting to see her reaction.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-fareast-font-family:
"MS Mincho"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Dawn looked up at
him for a moment before lowering her head. At that point she squawked in
surprise and tried to cover herself. One of the guards who approached had taken
off his cloak, and now reached forward to drape it over her shoulders. Dawn
thanked him and stood, clutching the coarse material tight around herself. “You
can start,” she announced, “by escorting me back to bed.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-fareast-font-family:
"MS Mincho"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The men around
them all grinned and nudged each other, while the women covered their mouths
and gasped, or tittered. Crimson puffed herself up and stormed inside in
impotent outrage. Dusk led Dawn after, at a more leisurely pace. The crowd
dispersed as they entered the house. They did not speak as they passed through
the halls. Dawn moved a bit stiffly, feeling the strain she had put on her
wounds. Dusk hoped she had not ruptured anything in her mad dash, and directed
her to the bed to examine her, as soon as they entered her room. She handed him
the borrowed cloak and stretched out on the covers, closing her eyes and trying
to relax. She sighed as he swept his hand across her skin, while probing deeper
with other senses. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-fareast-font-family:
"MS Mincho"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“You better get
dressed,” he warned her, when he was satisfied that she was perfectly sound,
“or I’ll be tearing off my clothes and joining you.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-fareast-font-family:
"MS Mincho"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“I’d like nothing
better,” she began, leveraging herself up and wincing, “but, I think I’ve
pushed my body far enough for one afternoon.” She finished sitting up and
scooted back to recline against the pillows. He noticed she made no move to
retrieve her nightshirt from the other side of the bed, though. Seeking out his
eyes, she spoke, almost apologetically, “I didn’t mean to let you find out that
way. I just wanted to know…”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-fareast-font-family:

even if I thought you weren’t real?”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

"MS Mincho"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Dawn sighed,
nodded.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-fareast-font-family:
"MS Mincho"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“I suppose I felt
a kind of love.” He stepped closer and settled back on the edge of the bed.
Seeing no apprehension on her face, he reached out and placed his hand on her
thigh, gently stroking the surface. “You were the best part of the best thing
in my life. I don’t know if that kind of love does you any justice. This
changes everything.” He allowed his hand to drift a bit, extending his caress
to the sensitive inner surface. For some reason, it seemed more important to
touch her than talk to her. Still, he tried to stimulate more talk to restrain
his curiosity. “Tell me,” he continued, meeting her gaze with curiosity, “how
did you find out. I mean, you must have always known about yourself. How did
you know I was different.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-fareast-font-family:
"MS Mincho"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>She sighed and
forced herself to keep her eyes level with his. “Do you remember the
messenger?” He raised an eyebrow and nodded. His hand stopped moving as he
tried to guess where this was going. She bit her lip, “Well, I followed you. I
followed you through the curtain.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span

"MS Mincho"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Dusk gaped at
her, and she quickly recounted her adventure. Dusk listened and stopped her
once, to have her recount her description of the sprite she had activated. She
hesitated, seeing a brooding look take over his features, and almost stopped to
ask what was bothering him, when that look grew darker at the description of
her encounter with Race Monkey. He waved her on, and she told the rest, about
orienting herself at the information kiosk and drinking down massive quantities
of information about the Threshold and the world beyond it, her struggle with the
implications and her retreat back to Aeirn. She concluded by confessing that
she had been struggling since then to figure out how to talk to him about her
discovery.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the Threshold, and in the history of Aeirn, as the Phoenix. She is an AI, an
artificial intelligence. She has never allowed anyone to use that device, and
trust me, there is no one who can out maneuver her. She’s the one who made this
place what it is. The only way you could have it is if she let you. I’d say,
only because she <i>gave </i>it to you. Which means she knew you could enter
the Threshold. She wanted you to,” he declared, looking somewhat disturbed. He

told her about his life on the outside, how he had discovered new properties in
the motes, which Phoenix had allowed him to harness. He told her how he had
been hunted by different groups who wanted to exploit his discovery and how he
had gone to work for the government in exchange for their protection. “The
problem is, my discovery was dependant on the capabilities of my AI, Phoenix.

Dusk’s revelations, but after she nodded off for a third time, Dusk had tucked
her under the covers and curled up beside her on the bed soothing her to sleep.
Regeneration still left her too drained to dream, so she woke up the next
morning refreshed. She could feel his bare chest against her back, and guessed
that he had eventually joined her under the covers. It was the first time they
had slept in the same bed since they were children. Allowing her hand to stray under
the sheets, she discovered that he had left his pants on. Apparently she was
going to have to be even more aggressive to break through his extraordinary

"MS Mincho"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>After completing
their preparations, the leader of their party, a knight by the name of Torrent,
directed them to report to an inn on the edge of the city. Dream Gate had long
since spilled over the ridge of the valley facing the sea, and across the Seven
Hills region. The inn Dusk and Dawn headed to in the afternoon lay just inside
the wall that had been erected to defend the outer city. On the way, the
encountered Torrent’s son and daughter, Rain and River. Rain was in their
class, and River was returning to act as a scout. Unlike Dusk and Dawn, who
were both red-headed natives of the Autumn Dominion, the brother and sister had
the thick white hair of their northern kin, the nobility of the Winter
Dominion. Dawn, as her alter ego, had known both of them for years, having
trained with Rain under his father during each summer away from initiation.
With the exception of the previous year. Thus, Dawn knew that their father was
the bastard son of some noble who had distinguished himself by becoming a
knight and marrying a noble-born daughter of the Dragon House. They had come
west after the Three Dominions were united into an empire, to help restore
order in the wake of the Purge, bringing their children with them. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

recognized Dusk, who had often come to Dream Gate to pursue his rivalry with
her other half, so it was hard for Dawn to listen to them talking about old
times while she walked with them in silence. For the tenth time, she winced as they
referred to the other Dusk.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span

believe he didn’t show up. He was the best dancer in our class,” Rain was
saying. “How many times did he leave you lying in the dirt, Dusk? Must have
been hundreds of times. He was unstoppable when he had his wits about him.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

being so cryptic, Dusk. He’s either dead, or he’s not dead. Which is it?” Rain
demanded.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

"MS Mincho"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>They turned their
faces to her and waited for her to respond. Dawn looked off into the distance
for a bit, trying to decide what to say, before meeting their eyes. “There was
an accident, while the two of us were training. He held on for quite a while.
It’s hard to say exactly what happened, but while searching for a cure to his condition
he started deteriorating rapidly. I lost track of him a few months ago and no
one has seen him since.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span

presumed dead?” Rain sighed and shook his head. “I’m sorry to say, if he didn’t
make it to trials, then he has to be dead. I just can’t imagine anything
keeping him from making it, if he really wanted to. And he really wanted to, to
prove that he was the best.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span

"MS Mincho"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“What a shame,”
River mourned. They walked on in silence until they reached the inn. River led
them to her father, who was waiting with other members of the party at a table
in the main room. The four joined them and soon food was brought out to them.
While Dusk and Dawn got acquainted with the rest of the party, River informed
Torrent about the untimely fate of the missing boy. The man seemed to brood
over it through the rest of the meal. Separate rooms had been reserved for the
young men and women of the party, which forced Dusk and Dawn to part for the
evening with great reluctance. Torrent came up on the couple as they stood in
the hall and laughed at their pained expressions.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span

"MS Mincho"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“I don’t know but
that I should send one of you back to join another party. You young love birds
had better shake it off and get your minds on business or this is going to be a
very short excursion. You have the rest of your lives ahead of you to moon over
each other. I recommend you put it out of your minds for the next few days.” He
put a hand on each of their shoulders and gently pushed them toward opposite
doors. “Now. Go to bed, and try to get some sleep. We’re out of here at the
crack of dawn, and I don’t mean, when you deign to wake up, young lady.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span

"MS Mincho"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Despite this
warning, Dusk and Dawn slipped out in the middle of the night to meet in the
stable. After ensuring no one could eaves drop on them, they huddled close to
talk. The night before, prior to Dawn’s seduction, they had discussed the
problem of the demon. The initial problem, of how to track it down, had been
made a little easier by the discovery that the group that had assaulted Dawn
had been influenced by their target. From what they knew, the group had been
possessed while they were probing the catacombs under the mansion at the heart
of the ruin. They were grateful that their trials would lead them into the same
area, since so much time had already been wasted. The question now was, how
were they to pursue the matter?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span

"MS Mincho"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“If we break away
from the party to chase after this demon, we’d risk forfeiting the trials
altogether. But,” Dawn proposed, “if we tell Torrent a little about it, he
might add it to our objectives.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span

"MS Mincho"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“I doubt he’d be
willing to risk the other initiates to pursue it. This is not your typical
demon. It can infect multiple hosts with its shadow. There is no question that
anything we happen to encounter will draw the party’s attention, and that we’ll
do our best to destroy it. I just think it’s best to draw it to us,” Dusk
argued. “This thing wants to get to Phoenix, and I am positive it will make a
move for you, if you give it a chance. Since you’ve been made a scout, you will
be free to rove away from the party and act as bait.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

delightful thought,” she grimaced. “I am not sure it would move against me if

the same thing happens that would happen if a priestess called on the Goddess

see if I can draw it out. Just be ready to run to my side if it has kin waiting

him to indulge her for a quick romp in the hay before they slipped back into
the inn. They immediately found themselves blocked. Torrent sat at a table in
the middle of the common room, talking to a man who seemed too familiar. As he
turned his head to shout for service, Dawn identified him as Thorn. Rather than
try to sneak back to their rooms from the outside, she pulled Dusk into the
shadows, and crept up on the two men.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
