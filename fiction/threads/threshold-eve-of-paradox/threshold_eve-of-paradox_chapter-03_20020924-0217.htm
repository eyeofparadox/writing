<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Dawn sat
patiently to the side of her strange benefactor’s group, studying an immense
water sculpture in the center of the plaza. Outwardly, she appeared composed
and natural, while inwardly she was in terrible conflict. It was almost
reasonable to say she was terrified and barely managing to keep herself in
check. Her mind raced around the information that had recently poured into it.
She had taken the stranger’s advice to reorient herself, but she did not like
the idea that act now forced her to confront. Little things, like how to
identify her benefactor as “Race Monkey” due to the strange creature in the
flying contraption darting around his head, were practical bits of information
she could deal with. It was the implications, taking all the bits of
information and putting them together, that disturbed her. Particularly since,
upon correcting his assumption about her, the final conclusion was that she did
not really exist.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>She certainly did not feel like a
fiction cut loose from a “fantasy game world.” If anything sounded like a
fantasy to her, it was the idea that all of this, everything she knew, existed
in the heart of a vast mechanism—a computer, she reminded herself—that could
not be seen or touched because it was all just information passing back and
forth between motes smaller than a speck of light. Her disbelief had caused her
to ask for more and more information, from the demon that never once tried to
rape her mind or steal her body. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The problem was, the more
information she received, the more sense it made. The harder she tried to find
a flaw in the data, the more evidence she was forced to confront. She had
gorged herself on alien history and technology, and it was impossible for all this
information to spontaneously pop into existence. There was a clear and logical
progression to everything she researched. She had not once run into an
explanation that wrote something off as inexplicable magic or miracles. Human
beings, in their desire to share their ideas, had created something that
allowed them to pool those ideas into some sort of collective dream. Since she
had been born in that dream, or some corner of it, she was a dream. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>But she was her own dream. She had
her own thoughts and feelings. She had her own reality. She would not be
screaming and fighting inside if she did not. She argued with herself, pointing
out that the very philosophy this alternate reality was founded on—the most
basic tenets of its “science”—was adherence to what could proven, through
measurement, observation, and repeatable experimentation. Science was an
impressive catalogue of what people outside of this Threshold knew. But it also
silently admitted that they did not know everything. She might need the rest of
her life to ascertain the true nature of reality. But, she could reach this
conclusion here and now. The Threshold was real. Its reality extended to that
which was created with it and in it. She might not exist outside of it, but she
did exist in it. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Her existence, while different in
nature, was valid.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Because people who lived outside the
Threshold might not perceive that, or believe it, it was entirely reasonable
that they would, without qualm, destroy her world, along with her, if it caused
them serious inconvenience. If the demons—the programs—that organized her world
became perverted and dangerous, and wreaked havoc in other areas of the
Threshold, her world could easily be seen as more than an inconvenience. It
might even be seen as a threat. In confronting herself, she could not deny that
rogue demons might not be the only threatening aspect of her world. The
implications were mind boggling, but there was no question that she would do
everything in her power to help Dusk protect their world from such an end. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>There was only one problem.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>She had gone over things in her head
and one thing had stuck out as an alarming possibility. Dusk was not, like her,
indigenous to her world. Race Monkey had assumed that she was, like him, a
denizen of that outer world, a master of the Threshold. He had reached this
conclusion by associating her with the Dragon, and that was Dusk. She had not
pursued that line of inquiry at the information kiosk, but she could refer to
her own experience with him and safely conclude that he was a “gamer.” The
things she had said to him that morning rang in her ears as the highest
testimony. He was so obviously out of place in her world she, in complete
ignorance, had noticed it. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Would it be a good idea to confront
Dusk here? Could she be risking her whole world by demonstrating how far she
had come to reach him? She found herself hoping that Race Monkey failed utterly
in tracking him down. It suddenly seemed far wiser to retrace her steps and get
back to where she belonged, before anyone figured out what she was. Not being
inclined to wait on someone else’s failure, she studied what she had learned
and came up with an excuse to disrupt his search. Standing up, she approached
Race Monkey.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“Still no joy,” he said, looking up
at her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>She frowned and studied the
translation before responding. “That’s alright. You’ve done enough by trying to
help me.” She put on a thoughtful expression. “I am thinking this is just some
kind of glitch. I am going to go log back in, log out, and see if that fixes
it.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“That might not be a bad idea. Well,
go try it. If you are still having problems, and the guide can’t fix it, look
me up and I’ll see what I can do.” He shrugged and shut down the programs he
had been working with.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“No problem. Thanks!” she leaned
over and kissed his cheek before departing. As casually as possible she
retraced her steps, not looking back until she had been swallowed by the crowd.
Once she had determined that no one was following her, she raced back to the
balcony where she had first emerged. While the Threshold had lost a great deal
of its mystery, it was just as strange as before. It revealed a lot about the
people of that unseen other world, if not about that world itself. There was a
lot more for her to learn before she would ever feel safe in its shadow, but
that would have to wait. She crossed over to the Annex, and worked out how to
return to where she had departed. She made haste to exit the gallery and lose
herself in the gardens. If anyone asked about her absence, she could just say
she had been dreaming, curled up in some obscure nook of the sprawling<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>temple. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>It was disturbing to discover, as
she entered the gardens, that it was now late evening. She did not think she
had been gone more than a couple of hours. By her estimate, she had lost
twelve. This was confirmed as twenty-one bells rang from the Sanctuary towers,
when she was halfway back to the hostel. Her mentor was going to lynch her for
vanishing for so long. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>It came as a relief to discover,
upon arriving at the hostel, that Amber had yet to return from conferring with
the master. A message had been delivered informing her that she had been free
to amuse herself for the day. She stationed herself in the common room to watch
for the arrival of Dusk and his cohorts, and catch a late evening meal. Amber
arrived while she was eating and joined her in silence. That meant the had a
great deal to talk about when they retired to their room. Dawn helped herself
to additional portions to delay their retreat, until Dusk finally arrived. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>When Dusk did appear, he came over
to apologize for running off on her. She forgave him easily when she detected
no suspicion of her own activities in him. He excused himself to eat, with her
blessings, after she promised him they could talk more the next day. Amber met
her eye with a smile and rose from the table. Dawn would not need to explain
her procrastination. Amber obviously had her own theory. If her universe had
not flipped end over end, it would have been entirely accurate. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Once they were secure in their room,
the great deal they had to talk about boiled down to: “Master Vinewood will
examine you a couple of days before the trials. There is no point rushing it,
since no amount of time will suffice if you are not equal to the challenge. Our
current crisis, however, is now this.” Amber held up a letter with the seal of
the Regent of the Phoenix House. It was addressed to Dawn in the care of her
master. She took it with a heavy sigh. Amber patted her on the shoulder, “Since
she can’t possibly be acting on what we discussed this morning, she has no
doubt invented something else.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>The letter
itself had been innocuous. It summoned her to attend the opening of Redleaf
Manor, when the Regent of the Phoenix House arrived the next day, and a
reception that evening, to ensure that all of Dream Gate was properly impressed
with the occasion. Naturally, as the heir, it would not be proper for her to
remain in a common hostel once she had the benefits of a functioning household,
with servants and staff to attend to her as her nobility demanded.
Incidentally, it would be ridiculous for Amber to presume upon this
hospitality, since adequate quarters were already provided for her, to impose
herself upon her charge. To do so would imply that the House was inadequate to
ensure Dawn’s protection. Years of such interventions had taught Amber and Dawn
how to interpret the regent’s machinations.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>She would go to greater lengths to
separate the two, but to do so at such a delicate time for Dawn, the preface to
the trials, was truly diabolical. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Not that they could say that. They
would never hear the end of how horrible and impertinent it was to suggest that
the regent’s conscientious concern for, and devoted duty to, Dawn, Chosen of
the Goddess, Heir to the Phoenix House and Legacy, was in any way suspect.
Which would lead into another attack on Amber, the “criminal” outcast, and her
damaging influence on Dawn. And the truth was, if Crimson hated anyone more
than Dawn, it was Amber. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Perhaps that was because Amber had
been recognized as a legitimate offspring of the Phoenix House, and Crimson had
not, although their histories had been nearly identical. Both of them had been
orphans discovered after the Purge, who had no way of tracing their heritage
back through the rubble of three generations of assassinations planned to
dissolve the house. Both of them had pursued noble rank through initiation, but
Crimson had schemed to enter the Phoenix House through marriage, and used all
of her influence, aided by undisclosed means, to ruin Amber. Disgraced in a
watertight plot, Amber was discharged from the house and denied the rank and
title she would have achieved through her initiation. Crimson, having survived
the massacres that ended the purge, found herself elevated to the position of
Regent over Dawn. Of course, if Dawn had not survived the last massacre
herself, the wealth and power of the entire House would have devolved onto her.
<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Dawn always dreaded the thought of
staying alone under the same roof with her. It gnawed at her gut all night
long, as she struggled in vain to sleep. Breakfast was a few bites she managed
to choke down with a great deal of water, which her stomach worried nervously
all the way from the hostel to the gates of Redleaf, a couple of hours later.
Dawn was hoping that Crimson had decided to be fashionably late. The woman
absolutely loathed the prospect of leaving her bed in the morning. At the same
time, she was an early riser, and expected everyone to be ready to attend to
her needs. The staff and servants had probably come straight up from the port
when the ship docked, and spent the whole night cleaning and airing the
premises in preparation. The gateman who let her into the grounds certainly
looked as tired and nervous as she. Dawn made her way to the main entrance, and
stationed herself there to await Crimson’s grand entrance. When this occurred,
at half past nine bells, the first thing her regent commented on was her wrung
out appearance. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“I don’t see how that woman can
claim to be taking good care of you,” she lectured as Dawn followed her into
the foyer. “It speaks well of you that you do not complain of her treatment of
you, Dawn. But certainly, your face speaks for itself. She’s taking advantage
of her position to take advantage of you. On top of all that training you do,
she must run you death with silly errands and menial tasks. I say, an initiate
must learn humility, I know I certainly did in my time, but there are limits. I
don’t know how you manage not to see it.” She turned and studied Dawn. Sighing
dramatically, she turned and led the way into a study. “You’re not too sharp,
girl. But, you’re the future of this house, and I aim to do all in my power to
see you come out well. You’re truly lucky to have <i>me</i> to look out for
you.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“I suppose there is a kind of luck
about it,” she responded in the appropriate pause. All bad, she thought to her
self with a wry grin. Crimson regarded her sternly. Dawn composed her face and
stared at a fixed spot to the left of her regent. The woman continued to regard
her until Dawn answered with the expected phrase, “Naturally I am grateful for
all you do.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“As well you should be. Now take a
seat and tell me how you and that fine boy, Dusk, have been getting along.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Dawn posed herself in the tall,
regal chair, in which it was impossible to relax and watched as her regent
settled herself comfortably upon the couch. She had performed this dance too
many times to miss that step. “Well, as you know, this is the first time we’ve
been in the same location for more than three months. We’ve only had a moment
to speak since I arrived, and if I may say without offending, my summons to see
you has caused me to miss my appointment with him.” She could not resist
sticking that pin under Crimson’s nails. Her scheming had gotten them
betrothed, it was delightful to blame it for coming between them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span

style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“Ah. Too bad, but I assure you it
was unavoidable. We will simply have to make it up to him this evening. I have
the best maids in waiting here to prepare you for this evening, and I have
informed his master to make some arrangements for him as well. You two should
look your best for the announcement of your wedding.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Dawn sucked in a breath and bit her
lip. “Tonight?” was all she dared ask. She hoped that question conveyed by
itself her protest at the timing of the event. What person in her right mind
would announce a wedding in the middle of trials? But that was the trap,
because of course, no reasonable person would expect a lady on the verge of
being married to participate in the trials. A man could certainly announce his
marriage in the middle of trials, all he had to do was show up at the proper
time. It actually worked to his advantage to come to the nuptials having so
recently proved himself. A lady was expected to absorb herself in the
preparations for the event. Crimson, playing her cards close to her chest,
simply raised her eyebrows, as if she could not imagine what might be wrong
with sharing the good news. “Are you sure this is the right time for such an important
announcement?” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“Yes, it is the perfect time,”
Crimson smiled lovingly. “It is exactly one year since you two were formally
introduced. It’s tradition. I know this seems sudden, but don’t worry. I have
everything planned.” <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Dawn tried to swallow the lump in
her throat, while commanding her hands to cling tightly to her knees. It would
not do to have them wrap themselves around her regent’s throat. In a strained
voice she responded, “Yes. I see that you do. And while I am fabulously
grateful, I do have one concern.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“Nonsense. There is nothing to be
concerned about. Dusk will be grateful to have you. Any man would. I understand
he is a bit absented minded, but I assure you, it does not mean he is
uninterested. No man is uninterested,” she winked. “I know you have worried
about that, you have told me many times. But, on your wedding night his eyes
will open and you will become his one and only. That is how it is with absent
minded men. They may stray in many directions, but not in that one.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Dawn was flushed, more out of
growing anger than embarrassment, but she was willing to work with it. “I,
truly, did not have any concerns in that regard. It is just, I have to ask. Are
you aware that I have trials at the end of this week? Surely there has been some
oversight.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Crimson made a good show of surprise
and agitation. Making all the proper noises, showing proper distress, but she
never swayed from her master plan. “This is so unfortunate,” she concluded
after a few minutes of squawking. “It seems such a shame to waste all of that
training, but what’s done is done. Everything has been arranged, and, so many
important people are expecting this.” Dawn did not doubt it. A lot of important
people would love to see the power of the Pheonix House fall into dragon hands.
Those people would certainly see to Crimson’s advancement as a reward for such
a brilliant sabotage. Of course, such a conspiracy would only be proven after
the fact. By then, it would be too late. “The announcement is really just a
formality, a confirmation. If we fail to make the announcement, our house will
look so bad. It could be seen as an insult to the Dragon House, maybe even the
Emperor himself!”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Crimson
had planned her trap exceedingly well. After dropping the bomb on Dawn, she had
sent the girl off to be bathed, primped, polished and dressed for the occasion,
conveniently assuring she could not get away to confer with her mentor. Perhaps
she counted on Amber’s well known aversion to psychic intercourse to ensure
that Dawn brooded helplessly in the clutches of her maids in waiting. What she
did not know was that Dawn herself had no such qualms about exposing her naked
thoughts to an equally useful ally. Though Dusk and Dawn had heeded their
mentors’ advice about not indulging in physical intimacy during their official
courtship, they had a long history of exchanging thoughts and feelings,
starting with their introduction to the psychic arts. It did not take long for
her to get his attention and relate the entire interview to her absent minded
paramour.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Dusk did not need a map and compass
to see how brilliantly Crimson had cornered Dawn. Dawn’s revelation preempted
the visit by Dusk’s mentor, conveying the news from Master Vinewood, allowing
him to alert Amber in detail before he too became tied up in preparations. Dusk
reached out to Dawn and assured her that the news had been passed on. Since
there was no way for their mentors to be excluded from such a public event,
they could count on some impressive fireworks to erupt when Amber finally had a
chance to confront Crimson. Until then, they agreed to focus on finding some
way to disarm or diffuse the trap before they were caught tight in its jaws.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>It did not occur to Dawn until after
their final contact that she had risked exposing everything she had learned the
day before to Dusk. After a moment of dread, she shook it off and assured
herself that she had been so outraged by Crimson’s actions, her thoughts had
been focused on nothing else. Dusk’s own thoughts had been equally well masked
by his irritation at the ridiculous distraction from important matters all of
this had suddenly become. If all she had cared about was his affection for her,
the tenor of his thoughts might have been painfully discouraging. The only
indication of his secret life was his eager anticipation to hear her decision
about joining his crusade. There was no doubt they would be talking about that,
as soon as they came up with a way to foil Crimson’s plot. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span

style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>As the day progressed and evening
approached, Dawn stormed her brain searching for anything that could diffuse
the situation. She was still scratching for ideas as she stood in a reception
line greeting the guests as they arrived. As Crimson had warned, the
establishment of the empire had taken a strong interest in this affair. Among
the lords and ladies who appeared before her were representatives of royal families
from every corner of the shattered continent, as well as the imperial heir,
representing the interests of the emperor and empress themselves. Ostensibly,
they had all come to observe the trials, in which some brother, sister, son or
daughter was participating. There was no way Crimson could have failed to note
this when she schemed to take advantage of their presence here to corner Dawn.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Dusk, when he paused before her to
take her hand in greeting, assured her with a confident smile and slight nod, that
he had come up with something. Her panicked expression changed to one of relief
as he moved on with the parade. He quickly vanished into the crowd of nobles
that circulated like a pot of boiling water. Eventually, Dawn had greeted and
exchanged pleasantries with all of the official guests, and was able to break
free to find some refreshment while tracking down her allies. Each of the
masters present for the trials had been received with the courtesies due to
their illuminated status, but their subordinate instructors, herding the throng
of mentors and initiates, had entered en mass through one of the side doors. It
took Dawn a while to find out if Amber had even made it into the manor. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>She had earlier caught a glimpse of
Dusk escorting the imperial heir, his cousin, into a private chamber.
Hopefully, he was putting whatever plan he had into motion. She just hoped
that, whatever it was, he had time to enlighten her before Crimson put the two
of them on the spot. When a couple tours of the main floor failed to turn up
either Amber or Crimson, Dawn knew at once the battle had been engaged in her
absence. Hoping that the improvised cloak of obfuscation she had picked up the
day before was more than wishful thinking, she focused on blanking herself out
and headed up stairs in search of the old rivals. No one seemed to notice, when
she stopped at the head of the stairs and surveyed the front hall. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Continuing into the residential
area, she allowed her mind to open up and receive impressions from whoever
might have ventured away from the party. She was able to quickly dismiss the
presence of servants and staff who idled in the wings. There were a few,
heated, presences in a couple of bedrooms, but not the kind of heat she
expected between such bitter antagonists. Their heat burned like a beacon from
the third floor, at the mansion’s furthest extremity. Heading in that direction
she quickly stumbled on an obstacle. The servants, overwhelmed by the task set
upon them, had isolated and closed off an entire wing of the house, assuring
the regent that repairs and renovations were essential before it could be lived
in. It had also made a convenient place to stow anything that seemed
unfashionably ancient or painfully difficult to clean and polish. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Dawn took one look at the clutter
and concluded that it was an ideal alarm system. Fortunately, she knew the
place far better than anyone could suspect. In another life, Redleaf Manor had
been “that big, old haunted house on the hill” among the boys of Dream Gate.
She—or back then, he—had explored every last nook and cranny a hundred times
over. Once she pin-pointed the location of her prey, she quickly thought of a
route that would put her in a perfect position to eaves drop. Slipping into an
unused bedroom, she slithered out of her priceless gown, and climbed out the
window onto a ledge. For once, she found herself wishing that her people had
adopted the custom of wearing undergarments, or that the dress itself had been
designed to be worn over a slip. Unfortunately, neither was the case and where
it would be impossible to clean her gown after two steps along her planned
route, a damp cloth would suffice to make her skin presentable. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Her hair, at least, had been braided
and pinned up out of her way. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>From the
window ledge, she carefully transferred her weight to fingers and toes,
clinging to the mortar cracks of the manor’s outer, stone wall. She progressed
carefully, reaching through the thick layer of ivy that competed with her for a
purchase on the wall, inching her way up to the roof. From there she crept
along the mossy, muddy slate to a peaked window awning, projecting from the
room where Crimson and Amber’s angry voices emerged. She slipped onto the
window ledge and anchored herself in a position where she could peer in through
the upper corner of the glass.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Amber
stood in the middle of the room, facing roughly in Dawn’s direction, scowling
at Crimson, who was just out of her field of view. “You’re absolutely
impossible, you stupid bitch!” Amber growled. Dawn almost spilled from her
perch in astonishment. Indignant noises spluttered from Crimson. “No. Shut up
and listen, you arrogant little whore. I am tired of hearing you use Dawn’s <i>welfare
</i>to excuse your abhorrent, self-serving conspiracies. You’re going to listen
to me for once. You’re going to listen, because the only thing you can do now
to stop me is challenge me to a duel, and we both know how that will end up.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“Very well. I am listening,” Crimson
suddenly crossed in front of Dawn, pacing before the window in obvious rage.
“But if you are wise, you will endeavor <i>not</i> to continue in such an
insulting manner. My patience with you is exhausted.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“That was true the day after we met.
I shall simply say this. If you dare to make this announcement, you are
threatening to destroy the last hope of the Phoenix House. Maneuvering to put
everything into Dusk’s hands, just to keep Dawn from getting it, is not even
protecting the welfare of the House. I don’t know what your problem with me is,
since you succeeded in destroying <i>my </i>life years ago, but whatever it is,
you must not persecute Dawn over it!”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“My objection, as I have made clear
from the very beginning, is that she was corrupted by you! You are the one with
a vandetta. You persist in saying I destroyed your life, when you can’t produce
a shred of evidence to support your claim. I tried to protect her from your
influence from the beginning, and now it is too late. You have had ten years to
warp her into your own creature. I am not about to let her acquire the power to
pursue your agenda.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“Crimson, you have the mistake of
allowing yourself to believe your own lies. This cannot go on.” She shook her
head and sighed, strugging for a reasonable tone of voice. “You made an
excellent choice in Dusk. He will be an excellent husband to Dawn, and I look
forward to their union. But not like this. If you make this announcement, and
cause Dawn to forfeit her initiation, everything is lost. Dusk can not help
destroying the House, if he becomes its head. He is not a phoenix, he does not
carry the Phoenix Legacy, and could not prevent the House from being absorbed
by the dragons. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“But ignoring that,” Amber sighed
and regrouped, “consider what you accomplish by forcing Dawn to forfeit her
career. Crimson, she is meant to be the champion of the Goddess, first and
foremost. The very reason the Phoenix House came into existence was to champion
the Goddess and protect the faith. How dare you interfere in that?”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Crimson snorted. “Who cares about
the Goddess? Did you not learn, as an initiate, that the old gods—all of
them—were a bunch of upstart sorcerers who used their knowledge of the art to
cow the rest of humanity into subservience. It sickens me that one of them
still holds sway over our lives. The rest of the world laughs at us for our foolish
obedience to her whims. By what madness do we owe all that we have accomplished
to some power hungry relic of the Cataclysm?”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Amber sucked in her shock. “I
remember you once ranting in a similar way against the nobility. Now that you
have wormed your way into the Courts, do you still feel that the nobility
should be torn down? No. I didn’t think so. You’re problem, Crimson, is that
you can’t stand the idea of someone having more power than you. You assume that
it is rightfully yours and yours alone, and you will stop at nothing to claim
it for yourself. I warn you. You defy the Goddess at your own peril. I am done
talking to you.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span

style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Amber turned on her heel and slammed
through the door. Dawn clung to the window sill, trembling, waiting for Crimson
to follow. As she did, her mentor’s last argument ran through her head. For
most of her life, Dawn had wondered what “Chosen of the Goddess” in her title
referred to. She had assumed, for the most part, that it was an honorarium, a
reference to her miraculous survival of the Dream Gate Massacre. She knew that,
historically, the Phoenix House had been founded by the champions of the
Phoenix, at the end of the Age of Gods, and that it existed to protect the
sanctuaries and priestesses of the Goddess. Its army, or in better times
armies, defended the rights and welfare of her people, and its champions,
paladins, prosecuted their enemies. She had assumed that her training had been
to master the legacy, to hold the titles of the house in trust through the
reconstruction. Was she also intended to become the first paladin after the
Purge?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The question kept her company as
Crimson left the room, allowing her to creep in through the window and sneak
back through the shadows to retrieve her gown. Along the way, she slipped into
a water closet and used the pump and a towel to scrub away the muck and grime.
Since she had less need to hide her presence, she was free to use her powers to
help make herself presentable as she dressed. Once she had returned downstairs
without incident, she sought out Dusk, hoping to confer with him before the
announcement. She was forced to move quickly, as Crimson appeared and seating
for the banquet began. She headed directly for the room where he had been
closeted with the imperial heir and let herself in quietly. They were still
seated together, but from the tone of their voices they had lapsed into
reminiscing about their childhood. Looking up as she cleared her throat, they
rose to greet her. Dusk introduced her to his cousin, who gracefully excused
himself, with a wink to both of them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span

earlier,” Dusk opened as he led her to the vacated seats.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“Ah. So I missed the show,” he
commented as he sat himself across from her. “How did it go?”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“Fabulous. Amber called her a bitch
and a whore, and dared her to challenge her to a duel over it. Crimson accused
her of being deluded, and claimed the Goddess was a fraud. It’s a wonder the
north wing was not reduced to rubble by lightening.” Dawn smiled as Dusk shook
his head and laughed. “Amber also declared that I was intended to become a
paladin, and Crimson was taking a big chance putting that at risk,” Dawn
confessed in a more self-conscious voice.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“Paladin?” Dusk cried in amazement.
Then he leaned back and tapped his lip, “That makes a lot of sense, actually. I
am surprised I didn’t guess. But, this is excellent. This guarantees my plan
will work.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span

she aimed a kick to his shin. “Be patient. You’ll find out soon enough. You’re
reaction is important, since it will keep her from suspecting a conspiracy on our

to you,” she growled, as he led her from the room. They emerged just in time to
be escorted to their places at the main table, between the regent and the
imperial heir. While Crimson fussed over Dusk, Dawn allowed herself to become
better acquainted with his cousin. His younger sister was completing her
initiation, and he had come to escort her home afterward. He talked openly
about his own initiation, completed a year earlier, and encouraged her to share
some of her own experiences. Being careful to avoid the insanity of her most
recent year, she entertained him with some of her mishaps and adventures, to
distract herself from the building tension. Finally, the remains of the meal
were cleared away and drinks were poured, with the obligatory toasts.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

tapped her glass for attention, the entire hall fell silent, and eyes darted
between her and the couple seated next to her. Master Vinewood placed a
restraining hand on Amber’s arm as she nearly jumped to her feet. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span

style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“My Lords and Ladies, and good
people all, it is my duty, and privilege, to announce tonight, the fulfillment
of a great promise between the two great houses of the North. If you will allow
me, I would like to introduce two fine young people, for those of you who may
not already know them.” She gestured for Dusk and Dawn to stand. “Dusk of the
Dragon House, son of Mi’night, Lord of Darksands, and Furnace, Princess of
Alten and Sister to His Imperial Majesty, Forge. Standing beside him, Dawn,
Heir to the Phoenix House and Legacy, Chosen of the Goddess, daughter of the
late Phoenix Ember, Head of the Phoenix House. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“One year ago, tonight, they were
formally introduced in light of their betrothal. In accordance with tradition,
I have the pleasure to announce to you all, the Union of Dusk and Dawn, at nine
bells midsummer morning, seven weeks and four days hence. If you would all
raise your glasses with me, to toast this happy occasion…” There was a short, sustained
rumble of people rising from their seats, accompanied by the soft chime of
jewelry on crystal as they reached for their goblets. “To the Bride and Groom.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The phrase echoed from the mouths of
several hundred witnesses, followed by cheers and whistles. When it died down,
Dusk cleared his throat for attention. Glancing at Dawn, and seeing curiosity
on her face, Crimson gestured for him to make his speech. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span

style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“There are,” he began, “very few
people who are not aware of the hard times that have befallen the Phoenix
House. I am certain that the loss of their leadership has been very hard for
the people of the Autumn Dominion, and that the ascension of the Dragon House
to replace them has been a cause for some concern. I am painfully conscious, as
the people await the elevation of a new head to restore the Phoenix House to
its former glory, that this engagement has also been a matter of some concern,
and I have spent some considerable time searching for a way to alleviate that
concern. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

the people, and their love for their former lords and masters, I have consulted
my cousin,” he indicated the heir, who nodded. “Together, we have determined
that, out of respect for the people and the traditions of the Autumn Dominion,
it is only just and reasonable to seek the blessings of the Goddess before
consummating this union.” Cinder reeled on her feet, struggling to keep her
face composed. Cheers and applause roared in approval of this announcement, on
one hand fueled by the joy of the devout, and the other by the respect of the
politically savvy. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

smiling and putting his arm around Dawn’s shoulder, “while I await the
Goddess’s pleasure. I intend to encourage my bride to be to bide a bit, and not
tempt fate with wedding preparations. Fortunately, we have trials coming up to
distract her!” He laughed, and the people laughed with him. The couple sat
down, holding hands openly on the table, and nodded gracefully as people began
rising in turn to toast the occasion. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

up and distracted me.” He looked at her and smiled. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
