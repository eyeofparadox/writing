mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>On the
second day after the official end of winter, the rain returned. Dawn chuckled
as her mount heaved and sighed in annoyance, while she secured her gear and
provisions and examined the tack. With several groups struggling to mount
expeditions into the ruins, they had all been forced to stand in the mud
outside the stables or beat each other senseless with their knees and elbows.
It was no wonder why Torrent had left his charges the previous morning to
secure the rooms they had enjoyed for the night. Sharing her room with three
other girls, Dawn had been swarming in luxury compared to the males in the
party, who grumbled about the close confines of their own lodging. She was just
glad she had been able to sleep.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Peering over the back of her horse,
she spied on Torrent and Thorn as they stood arguing at the end of the
courtyard. The previous night her lungs had almost burst as she waited for her
party leader to respond to Thorn’s challenge. After several breathless moments,
the knight had grumbled and declared that he hardly knew Dawn. He was not about
to mar his own name by betraying one of his charges over an ill reported
offense. The fact that Phoenix Dusk had loved her enough to forfeit his future spoke
well of the girl, in his opinion. Since it was well known that she was
betrothed to Dragon Dusk, she could hardly be blamed for moving on from that
relationship before it brought her down too. Dawn would have loved to hear
where the rest of the conversation had gone, but Torrent had filled his cup and
announced it was his last before he checked on the students and bedded down for
the night. She and Dusk had raced around to an open window and climbed up
through it. They were in bed when Torrent checked, pretending to be asleep. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>From the sensation their absence
caused among their peers, there was a chance Torrent might learn they had
absconded for a little friendly fornication, but hopefully not that they had
been eavesdropping while he all but conspired to get Dawn killed. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>That would make the next three
nights painfully awkward.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Dodging a glance from the two men in
her direction, Dawn refocused her gaze to study the four members of their party
she had met the day before. One of them she knew as the other local prodigy, an
intimate friend of Rain’s. Lion was an import from the Summer Dominion, with
the golden hair and masculine beauty that made his name painfully appropriate.
The combination of a robust sense of humor, a playful nature and deadly sharp
wit made him a notorious prankster. He was the reason she had not risked coming
to Dream Gate the summer before. If he had discovered the condition that had
resulted from merging with her other half, he would have tortured her to death
exploiting it for fun, and the whole world would have known her secret by the
start of autumn. He was also one of the best friends she’d had as a boy. As a
girl, her feelings turned in another direction entirely, which her fiancée
could hardly approve of. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The other three were a bit safer for
her to contemplate. The boy, Fox, was a slight thing with dark, auburn hair and
severe features. She had been told that he didn’t speak, but he was fiercely
intelligent and agile. Dawn thought he would have made an excellent thief, since
his knack for silence extended to his every movement, while his gestures and
expressions spoke volumes. The two remaining girls were an interesting
contrast. One had the black skin and white hair of the arctic mountain fey, and
went by the name Akashi. The other, Silk, had the pale skin and raven hair of
the most powerful merchant families of the Three Dominions. It was hard to say
which was more likely to pursue a career as an assassin. That natural
assumption probably explained why the two had turned to each other for
companionship. They might not trust each other any more than others trusted
them, but it gave them something in common. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Seeing that everything was in order,
she led her horse over to Thorn. River joined them a moment later, and the
former mentor detailed their responsibilities as outriders to the heart of the
ruins. They would flank the party to either side, while Thorn rode ahead. They
would form a triangle that kept all of them at the limit of eyesight to each
other, ensuring they were easily observed by the rest of the party. The party
would be joined by three men who would take charge of the horses when they
reached the mansion and lead them back to the inn. On the third morning, they
would ride back out with the horses for their return to the city. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>By the time everyone was mounted and
headed out of the West Gate, the sun lit the clouds on the horizon. Light
occasionally lanced through a break in the overcast, relieving the gloom with
sudden, brilliant color. Dawn spurred her mount into the woods, taking the
right flank, while the rest of the party turned onto the road that cut through
it. Things were significantly darker under the canopy of the trees. It made for
a poor roof, penetrated by a veritable hail of swollen droplets pawing through
the underbrush. As she wove her way through the natural columns, the others
flickered in and out of sight. A quarter hour of these mind numbing cadences
prompted her to reach out to Dusk. A silent conversation was just the thing to
lighten the tedium of her isolation. They exchanged thoughts amiably for a
while, until Torrent pulled up beside her fiancée for a private exchange. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“I understand you and Dawn slipped
out last night,” he began.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Dusk studied him and smiled gently.
Rather than excuse Dawn, he urged her to listen in. “We thought it would be
best to get some things out of our system before hitting the ruins. You know
how it is, the prospect of battle,” he shrugged. “I hope you don’t think that
was out of line, Sir. We are<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>engaged,
after all,” he added unnecessarily. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The knight grunted. “I can’t argue
with human nature, and you don’t seem to be suffering from the lack of sleep.
Ah, the powers of youth.” He chuckled and glanced over the party. “Naturally,
we’re all aware that the two of you are on the verge of getting married.” He
wiped his face and rubbed his jaw thoughtfully before adding, conversationally,
“I understand that, apart from the trials, there was another obstacle to your
union?”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“I figured that would get out. What
do you know of it?”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“I believe there was a question
about your feelings for the girl,” Torrent paused, and Dusk nodded. Torrent
pressed on, “I hate to presume on rumor, but, do these doubts have anything to
do with your rival?”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“Phoenix Dusk?” Dusk offered an
incredulous look. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Torrent sighed and hardened his
gaze, “You were aware that the boy was sleeping with your fiancée? According to
Thorn, you were around during that summer. You were all training together,
correct?” Dusk nodded again. The knight pressed on, “I understand that affair
is the reason he is not here today.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Dusk considered that. “I suppose
that it’s true that he was sleeping with her. Technically. Under the
circumstances, they didn’t really have a choice, forced to live together like
that,” he temporized, without explaining. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Torrent raised his eyebrows. “You
say they were thrust upon each other by outside circumstances?” Dusk nodded. “I
suppose that happens. I can think of a number of reasons a couple of initiates
might be put up together. I don’t doubt his father had something to do with it.
He was the only one who would have dared try to engage those two. Guarantee his
sons inheritance by joining his claim to hers, both of them win, technically.
Still, it can’t sit well with you now, to know how intimate they must have
been.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Dusk shrugged as the knight shook
his head. After what he had overheard the night before, it was not hard to see
what Torrent was up to. “I think people assume too much. In some ways they were
closer to each other than anyone can imagine. I can’t say I know what they did,
but I know what they could not do.” Torrent raised an eyebrow. “There was no
actual sex.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“I was under the impression there
was no doubt they had intercourse.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“Trust me. It wasn’t possible. For
one thing,” Dusk pointed out with a grin, “they had the same mother.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“Now that can’t be true. Dusk was
the son of Cinder and Ash. His father told me the whole story.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“He believed what he wanted to
believe. For his story to be true, Dusk would have to be several months younger
than Dawn, but in fact they were born on the same day. You know that Dawn’s
birth was kept a secret for years, until her mother’s promotion flushed her
out.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“But… that would make them twins.
That also means that Dawn is not Ember’s offshoot.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“I shouldn’t have pointed that out.
You must tell no one,” Dusk grabbed the other man’s arm. Torrent nodded. “To
think that I revealed that when I was trying to hide my real assurance that she
did not have sex with him.” He sighed, “Torrent. She was still a virgin when <i>we
</i>started sleeping together.” He gave the man a look that left no room for
doubt.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“Then why did Dusk throw his career
away?”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“You have to ask Dawn. She’s the
last person I know who saw him.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Dawn retreated into her own thoughts
as Torrent spurred his mount to the head of the column. Dusk had done a fair
job of dispelling Torrent’s concerns about her, but at what cost? He had
brought into question her very identity. Her claim to the Phoenix House was
largely undisputed because people thought she was the reincarnation of her
mother. Her birth was supposed to have proven Ember’s mastery of the Phoenix
Legacy and caused her to be named its head after the Border Massacre. She had
never really questioned the assumption and now wondered what might be
discovered if someone pursued an investigation. Her inheritance would surely
come into question, but her recent enlightenment made her less concerned about
her duty to preserve one house when the whole world was at risk. After the
trials, she could not end up any worse than Amber, who still had great
prospects ahead of her as a disciple of the Magus. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>She decided she would talk to Dusk
about it later. He had been backed into a corner. He could not explain the real
relationship between her and his namesake without revealing her secret. Though,
it was hard to see how the truth could be more damaging than the fiction Dusk
had now endorsed for Torrent. She might just have to confide the truth to
Torrent and nip this lie in the bud. Of course, that would require showing him
a side of her she did not care to manifest. It might revive questions she had
laid to rest.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>She turned her attention outward,
drinking in the sights of the forest, and keeping alert for signs of danger.
This became a little easier as the rain stopped and the sun came out. As things
heated up, she threw her cloak back and admired the wonder of the mist boiling
up among the trees. Soon enough, the ground began to rise as the party mounted
the foothills of the ruins. When she paused on a hill top clearing to scan the
area, she glanced out toward the sea and noted that they had been granted only
a short reprieve from the rain. Another storm was headed in toward them, dark
and angry. She sighed, there would have to be a thunderstorm the night she
returned to face her nightmares. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>It was
close to the midday hour when they arrived in the heart of the ruins. After
passing the foothills, they had entered a garden of awesome proportions. Vines
as thick as tree trunks twisted around the stones and pillars of an ancient
civilization, so well wrought they ignored the crushing embrace and sneered at
the oncoming storm. If tens of thousands of years had not weathered them, even
the worst of nature’s tempers could not faze them. The style of the architecture
was instantly familiar to anyone who had visited the Sanctuary of the Goddess,
where attentive hands had kept similar growth from attesting to similar age.
The groups that had shadowed them on the road had mostly split off to venture
into the outer reaches as they continued deeper into the eerie stillness. The
few that had followed them further in had split off in turn at the last rise.
Mounting the pinnacle of the lost civilization, they came into view of the
sprawling manor.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span

anything they had seen, but it showed the signs of modern renovation,
undertaken to make it a livable retreat for the scions of the previous
generation of phoenix lords and ladies. The grounds encompassed a small temple
and the barracks and fortifications which made it possible for humans to endure
the long nights cut off from the outer world. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>With the sky threatening, they
quickly dismounted and collected their gear. Once more they checked their
provisions, before turning the horses over to their attendants and waving them
on their way. The scouts had checked the perimeter ahead of the party’s
arrival. There was some discussion of using the barracks as a place to
establish their base camp and spend their first night. Dawn coughed and
suggested that, in her experience, the manor itself was more secure. It was a
not so subtle reminder that the massacre had begun with the corruption of the
soldiers sleeping in that very structure. Besides, the manor would be much more
comfortable. They entered the foyer and stowed their gear, while they
concentrated on scouting and securing the mansion for the night. Dawn was the
first to venture into the main hall, pausing to shake the image of blood stains
and children’s corpses out of her mind. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Her first thought, on looking at the
hall with more experienced eyes, was that it resembled the Annex rather
strikingly. It was a vaulted, narrow chamber. At one end was a vestibule and
foyer, at the other two grand stair cases curving to either side, a raised dais
nested in their oval frame. The balcony that ringed the hall was recessed
behind the great columns, so the walls had the illusion of rising uninterrupted
clear to the roof. In between the columns hung portraits that had disturbed and
fascinated her as a child, and shiny placards she had been too young to read.
In a bizarre way, the themes of the images were also a host of human traits and
virtues. She turned to look at Dusk.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“I noticed the resemblance. I wonder…”
he broke off and approached one of the pictures. He stretched out a hand and
laid his fingertips gently against the frame and closed his eyes. They popped
open a moment later in surprise. He turned to speak to Dawn and noticed the
rest of the party filing into the hall with curious expressions. He cleared his
throat and revised what he had been about to say. “I don’t think these are
recent additions. They have the feel of ancient artifacts. Which is strange.
The magic they thrived on was supposed to have vanished with the gods.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The initiates all exchanged looks
and proceeded to examine the portraits. Torrent stepped forward and asked Dusk
how he could make that assessment. Dusk reminded him that he and Dawn had been
tutored on occasion by the Magus himself, and introduced to relics of the first
embodiment of magic. “I don’t recommend studying them too closely. According to
the legends the gods created these things to alter their very nature.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Unfortunately, this warning came a
bit too late, as two or three initiates stumbled back from various paintings
with cries of shock or alarm. Dawn’s eyes darted from one to the next, as
Torrent and Thorn shook their heads and moved to discover what trouble their
charges had gotten into. It was hard to tell what had happened, until Dawn
looked at Rain. Unless she was mistaken, Rain was suddenly a girl. Her eyes
darted back to the other two. The elf, Akashi, seemed, possibly, to be taller.
Or else her clothes had shrunk considerably in the rain. Looking at Lion, she could
not make out any transformation, but Rain! She turned back to him, her feet
unconsciously propelling her closer to her old friend, and studied him—her
carefully.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span

gasped, in an unfamiliar voice.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“Goddess, Rain!” That was River,
practically eating her fist in shock.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“Rain. You… you’re a girl,” Lion
choked. He stared in amazement, then doubled over laughing. Everyone paused to
look at him, but it did not seem like he was going to stop. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“I don’t think you spoke up in time,
son,” Torrent declared, turning his head to address Dusk. His voice was tight
as he struggled with his instincts as a father and his duty as the party
leader. Both men were a step behind Dawn as she rushed up to examine Rain. As
she stopped in front of Rain, she found herself impressed at how well he seemed
to be taking this shocking transformation. He stared at his hands, a moment,
then casually began patting his body down, confirming what was, and what was
not, there. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“I’m a girl,” she said, meeting Dawn’s
eyes. “I should be freaking out, right?” It came out sounding so calm, so
rational, Dawn could not help nodding in total sincerity. She remembered how
her other half had reacted after finding himself in her body. He had nearly
fainted. Poor Rain probably just did not know how to react to the shock. Rain
turned back to the picture she had confronted a moment before. Dawn risked a
glance at it, and the attending placard. It read, bluntly, “Sex.” The picture
showed, to her chagrin, a scene she could recall from her own life; a girl and
a boy, identical in all other respects, stood naked, confronting each other. “I
don’t get it,” Rain complained.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“That’s odd,” Dawn frowned beside
him. “I stared at these pictures for hours as a girl. They never did anything
to me then.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Dusk approached the painting
carefully and touched the frame. He soon frowned. “It’s discharged.” He crossed
his arms, right forearm cocked up to he could prop his chin on his fist, and
thought. “That could be it. In the war of the gods, the gods tried to cripple
their opponents by depriving them of powerful artifacts. They did this by
destroying the source of their power. The artifacts themselves were often too
well made to deteriorate. They just lay dormant until someone found them and provided
them with new power. The destruction of artifacts actually happened during the
Cataclysm when conjurors used the souls of their victims to power them for the
conflicts that ensued through the next four thousand years.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“I am guessing that these things got
charged up somehow,” he proposed, “enough to work once at least. I am sorry,
Rain. I don’t think we can reverse your, um, transformation. At least not until
we figure out a safe way to charge this artifact and use it again. I strongly
suggest that no one messes with anything else in this house without sensing for
the presence of magic first.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Everyone muttered, while Dusk went
over to see what pictures the other two had exposed themselves to. Torrent
stepped up to Rain and spoke with her softly while everyone else focused on
Dusk. Akashi’s transformation was confirmed as Dusk read the placard. “Height.
Relatively harmless. Do you mind being taller, Akashi?” Akashi shrugged,
smiling as she realized she was now at eye level with Silk. “You might have some
problems in common with Rain. The change in stature might compromise your
reflexes and coordination.” Torrent and Thorn nodded their agreement. Dusk
stepped over to the third painting and laughed, “Oh, fabulous. Intelligence.
You really needed that, Lion. Looks like you came out ahead in this mishap.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“Are you sure it didn’t diminish his
intelligence?” Rain scowled.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span

anyone else get zapped?”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Dawn, turning to see if anyone
responded, found her gaze trapped by a painting and squawked. Everyone looked
at her as she struggled to avert her eyes. Thorn darted forward to read the
placard, then risked a glance at the picture. The portrait, depicting a woman
with all of her skin peeled off, quite reasonably terrified Dawn, who had been
mystified by it over a decade ago. Her heart pounded as a chilling tingle
engulfed her body. She sensed Dusk rushing to her side. Her eyes squeezed shut,
imagining this fatal disfigurement being replicated on herself. The shock
passed and she panted, afraid to find out what had happened. Dusk grabbed her
and shook her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span

at her hands and seeing they looked perfectly normal. She had not been skinned
alive. She looked up,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>wondering why no

style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Dawn closed her eyes and reached out
to Dusk, trying to peer at herself through him. At first she did not see any
significant difference. She recognized her features, familiar and unchanged.
Her hair as unruly as ever, a rich red contrasted by her pale flesh. After some
moments of study, however, she noticed the polish and poise that had not been
there before. It did not sit with having braved the wind and rain on horseback
for several hours. Her appearance, basically unchanged, had been refined. Her
natural beauty, of youth and excellent health, had been augmented. Her mind
searched for a word to describe the quality that had been added and could only
spit out elegance. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span

center of the room,” Torrent reprimanded. “These things are dangerous. There’s
no telling what all of them do.” Everyone turned their eyes to the floor and
retreated as ordered. When they were gathered in the middle of the hall, their
backs to the portraits, the knight turned and asked, “Dawn, you said you used
to study these things. Can you recall what else they do?”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“I couldn’t read when I was that
young. I remember the pictures well enough though.” She described them,
pointing in their general directions, while the others tried to guess what
attributes they affected. The man with the top of his head chopped off, holding
his brains in his hands, Lion had already looked at. Akashi had studied the one
featuring a man stretched out on a rack. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>People guessed the themes as she
started describing others. A painting of a bony little man collecting severed,
muscular arms and legs in a wheelbarrow, Torrent and Thorn proposed to
represent strength. One featuring a sickly mother nursing a robust child, River
thoughtfully named constitution. Two remarkably similar ones, a man with empty
eye sockets fumbling with his hands in bowl full of eyeballs of differing shades,
and a bald woman collecting the scalps of fallen soldiers in a basket, were
guessed to alter eye and hair color. A horribly disfigured man leading handsome
men into battle suggested charisma. A lady with all of her fingers chopped off,
for dexterity. An old hag strangling a young girl, as her mother watched in
horror, might have represented age. A youth juggling swords in the air,
surrounded by others who were impaled, would have to be agility. The list
seemed to cover a score of attributes, many of which they could not even guess.

style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“I hesitate to guess how these
things work,” Torrent began, studying Rain with a pained look, “nor would I
care to experiment. However, if these were in fact tools, and not traps, their
effects must depend on some choice on the part of whoever engages them. Perhaps
even so far as what draws a particular person to become absorbed in a
particular image. I gave several of these a hard look as I passed by.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

waved her down with one hand. “I watched you, Rain. You examined every image on
that side of the hall. The one that got you was, what, the sixth, the seventh?
What made you pay more attention to that one in particular? I am trying to understand.
You tell me what happened.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

started to redden. “I can tell you what was going through my mind, when I got
zapped.” She waited for Torrent’s attention. He looked at her and gestured for
her to go on. “When I first looked at it, I just looked at it. I did not want
to get sucked into the image, but I couldn’t help myself. I wanted to look
away, but something in the back of my mind insisted I look closer. The harder I
tried to look away the more insistent the feeling got. Like there was a point
to it, a message. Something I understood about it I needed to pay more
attention to. I could remember studying it as a child, wondering why someone
would peel their own skin off. I mean, I could see, from the way she was built,
from her proportions, that she must have been very beautiful. Why would she
ruin herself like that? Unless,” she paused for emphasis, “she could not take
it for granted. Maybe she did it to find out what made her beautiful, to see
what was under the surface.” Dawn shrugged. “When I started to think of it like
that, started to think about how <i>I </i>was put together, I began to tingle
all over.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>There was a moment of silence as
people mulled this observation over. Rain in particular looked thoughtful,
glancing back toward the picture that had affected her. Fox began tapping his
foot and glancing around. He paused, looking toward the entrance, and then
nudged Torrent, gesturing toward the door. The knight glanced outside and then
announced that it was getting dark. The storm was rolling in fast. As it
blotted out the sun, the creatures within the ruins would likely rouse into
activity. They did not have time to worry about the transformations if they
wanted a secure perimeter against the haunts. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Dawn suggested a few places where
they could fortify themselves against an army with just the ten of them.
Torrent wanted the party to conduct a sweep of the mansion while the light was
good, so everyone could familiarize themselves with the area in case they had
to move during the night. Dawn quickly described the layout of the mansion, as
well as the locations of probable artifacts to avoid. With a last caution about
tripping over themselves again, the party was split for a quick reconnaissance.
In two groups of five, they conducted a room to room search of the upstairs and
downstairs, securing windows and doors, while searching for a defensible place
to camp for the night. They soon discovered that revived artifacts were not the
only danger. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The campers that preyed on the
denizens of the ruins had lay traps all over the place. Dawn stumbled into one
that sent her crashing from the main floor into a cellar, where she jumped
quickly to her feet, anticipating the onslaught of demons or undead out of the
darkness. Her first instinct, to levitate back up, was confounded by a mind
jarring shock. As she reeled from the psychic booby-trap, she drew her sword
and put up her guard. A few long, breathless moments ensued, with the thunder
of footsteps from above as the others ran to investigate her fall. When nothing
leapt out at her, she turned to study the walls with her hands, looking for a
purchase to scramble back up. Stumbling over bits and pieces she did not care
to identify, she followed the wall around to her right. She quickly discovered
that there were no exits from the room, and even if she could scale the wall,
no way to reach the opening she had fallen through. A stone twisted in her hand
as a rope dropped down from above.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span

something down here,” she called back up as the stone slipped free of its
mortar in her hands. Biting her lip, peering through the shadows into the hole
she had just opened up, she tried to decide what to do. Stretching her senses
carefully, passively, she detected a couple of objects inside, but nothing
indicating a trap. Sensing a startling power in both objects, she impulsively
darted her hand in and pulled out what appeared to be a deck of cards wrapped
in some kind of silk, and a signet ring. Her eyes widened as something like a
shock of recognition passed through her. The others shouted down for her to
hurry up, intruding on her musing as she turned the objects over in her hands
curiously. They could be examined later, she consoled herself. She pocketed
them and quickly grabbed onto the rope. Slithering up, as the others pulled,
she was quickly free from the darkness. When the others asked her what she found,
some impulse urged her to say it was nothing, her imagination. Initiates were
expected to come back with some trophies of their adventure, she rationalized. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>After a
complete sweep of the first and second floor, the two groups met in the
library. After a short consultation, Torrent told Thorn to take his group and
continue searching the third floor and the towers, while the knight took his
group down a level to check the cellars and look for the entrance to the
catacombs. Dawn, Akashi, Fox and Rain followed Torrent back to the cellar
stairs as Thorn led Dusk, Silk, Lion and River up to the third floor. That
group had already, tentatively, picked out a place for the party to camp for
the night, and just needed to make sure it was secure from above as well as
below. Dawn’s group broke out torches and headed down to see if there was any
immediate threat from the depths. The tour of the cellars turned up a number of
storage rooms, an armory, a couple of furnace rooms, three or four archival
chambers, fruit and wine cellars, a meat locker, and a group of twelve undead. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>This was, in Dawn’s experience, the
first time she had faced the living dead. As the scout of their group, she had
shared the lead with Torrent, and had the misfortune to be the one who stumbled
into the lair. Her first impression had been that she had entered some kind of
morgue. Bodies were laying atop of stone slabs, or leaned up in narrow alcoves.
Standing in the door, torch in hand, she took one look and backed into the
hall, calling to the others. She watched in dread fascination as the corpses
stirred in response to her presence. The four stretched out on slabs
laboriously levered themselves up to sitting positions, while another six
lurched upright and began to shamble out of their alcoves. With each movement,
a cloud of dust and rot tainted the air. Dawn had to struggle not to gag as the
scent billowed through the door.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Torrent was by her side as the first
four made it to their feet and joined the other six in their advance. They were
almost taken by surprise when two more corpses burst through the cobwebs
covering the walls of the corridor, from concealed niches. Dawn lashed out in a
series of strikes, half expecting her target to disintegrate under the force of
her blows. The dry flesh was surprisingly firm and substantial. The creature
staggered back a couple of steps and resumed its advance. Torrent had not fared
much better, as his opponent ignored the thrust of his sword, disarming him
when the following kick sent the ghoul staggering into the wall. Fox, who had
been a few steps behind Torrent, caught the creature from behind. He slipped an
arm around its neck and twisted violently, producing a jarring series of pops and
cracks as the motion shattered the cervical column. Fox completed the graceful
assault by dumping the body on the floor, but it lumbered back to its feet,
head hanging at an unnatural angle. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Dawn stood her ground at the door,
drawing her sword to threaten the mob in the room while her first opponent
loomed over her in the hall. She heard as Torrent retrieved his sword from the
mindless zombie, shouted for him to watch the door, and lunged at the immediate
threat. She pounded on the sentry with a series of kicks and strikes, backing
it down the hall, so the rest of her group could advance and engage the other
monsters as they tried to come through the door. From the sounds, the other
three were currently trying to dismantle the one Fox pulled off of their
leader. Once Dawn had room to swing her sword, without clipping one of her own,
she started chopping her foe into pieces, starting with the hands that reached
out for her. It took a while to reduce the thing to quivering bits, taking care
that no bit was whole enough to pose an independent threat. By the time she was
done, her sword was covered in thick, black ichor. A fair amount of which was
spattered on herself.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Torrent noticed she was returning to
his side, and let one of the creatures through the door, directing it toward
her. Dawn saw their leader was feeding other zombies one at a time to the trio
of initiates on his right as well. Her next foe was another sentry, about as
mindless as the first. She tore into it, sensing from the sudden ring of magic
in the back of her mind that Torrent would need help soon. She found herself
wishing she felt threatened enough to stumble across that deadly weapon in the
back of her mind, but these were not demons. Animated death was just not that
scary in comparison. Once her foe was disarmed, so to speak, she glanced down
the hall and observed the system the trio had going. Torrent passed a zombie
off to Fox, who broke various bones and dislocated various joints before
passing it on to Rain and Akashi. Those two hacked at the knees, neck and
elbows as they kicked the zombie back and forth between them, and tossed the
parts into a small bonfire they had started with the first corpse and the torch
Dawn had dropped to defend herself. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Fortunately, the oily smoke this tactic
produced had found some vent above them to escape through or they would all
have been suffocating as the third body fed the flames. They were working on
their fifth victim as Dawn finished playing with her second. The last sentry
came toward her without its head, as Torrent warned them that the last four
were intelligent, possibly vampires. Fox darted past the knight to help Dawn
finish the last sentry as quickly as possible, so they could join their leader
against the greater threat. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Torrent, taking advantage of a good
strike to blood his sword, tested his theory by flicking his weapon toward the
fire. The spray of blood ignited explosively as it hit the flames. He ordered
Dawn and Fox to cover the door as he stepped over to the fire and speared a burning
chunk of thigh. He returned to the door and advanced on the vampires with this
makeshift torch, forcing them to retreat into the room. While he held them at
bay, he issued warnings and instructions to his charges. These undead were
animated by the blood of true dragons, and possessed many of the same traits as
dragon lords. They could wield magic and psychic arts. They also had natural
regeneration and rejuvenation. If they fed, they could walk among humans
undetected except in direct sunlight. That and fire were their only true
weaknesses.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Akashi promptly strung her bow,
asking the other initiates to wrap cloth around the heads of her arrows. Rain
prepared a torch to light her arrows. With these preparations, Dawn and Torrent
took up torches and entered the chamber to flush out the vampires, who had
listened to the whole exchange grimly and run for cover inside the room. A
flood of pleas and promises issued from the mouths of the vampires as the scout
and the knight advanced, begging for mercy and offering the gift of immortality
and eternal youth, if they were spared. If they had not looked so much like
desiccated corpses, their pitiful cries might have touched a chord with Dawn’s
humanity. Seeing them as they were, however, there was no difficulty reminding
herself that these were cold blooded predators who exploited their human
origins to trap their prey.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>As they flushed the monsters out,
Akashi sunk two or three well aimed arrows into each. The flaming missiles
evoked terrible screams and convulsions from the vampires, as they exploded
into flame. Out of pity, Dawn took her sword and made a quick round of the
room, decapitating the four to cut short their agony. The room rapidly filled
with smoke, forcing her and Torrent to retreat for air. The group remained long
enough to see that all of the remains were reduced to ash, before completing
their tour of the basement. The entrance to the catacombs, when they finally
found it, appeared to be directly under the main hall. They found a concealed
staircase that let out into the corridor behind the dais. They went to collect
the gear they had stashed in the foyer and wait for the other group to come
down and report on their findings. Dawn wandered to the entrance and looked out
into the rain.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

muttered under her breath. Dawn glanced behind them, noticed Torrent looking in
their direction, and led Rain out to stand under the awning. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

nodded. “Not sure how the new plumbing works?”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

so upset when I tried to, you know, whip it out and it wasn’t there. I just
couldn’t relax, then my dad started pounding on the door telling me to stop
playing with myself and keep up with the group!” she fumed and fidgeted. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

guess that cut a little close to the truth,” Dawn commented acerbically. “Hey

happened.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

and shoot thing you have to go through if you don’t want to piss all over
yourself. It’s kind of hard when there’s nothing to hold onto and you’re not
even sure where it comes out. So I started poking around and got distracted,”
she shrugged and returned her gaze to Dawn. “But if I don’t do something quick,
I’m gonna burst!”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

problem would take care of itself, but it wouldn’t be very kind. Let’s step
around the corner and I’ll walk you through it.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>
