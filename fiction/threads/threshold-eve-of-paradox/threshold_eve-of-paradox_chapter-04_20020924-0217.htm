mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>Crimson had taken the first
opportunity to drag Dusk and Dawn aside and demand an explanation of his
declaration. She protested that the blessings of the Goddess were petitioned in
the ceremony itself. She expressed a critical concern that his “delaying” the
preparations was a prelude to backing out of the engagement. Unfortunately,
Dusk had already claimed the high ground. The political concerns he had
addressed were very real. He calmly assured her that he intended to petition
the Goddess at the first opportunity. She was not in the habit of refusing to
hear such petitions, so there was no cause for alarm. When Crimson still
insisted that prompt attention to the preparations for the wedding was necessary,
he suggested that she focus on getting everything in order. Once he had the
Goddess’s blessings, Dawn would be able to quickly complete her preparations.
Since a date had been announced, everything else could be arranged accordingly
needing only Dawn’s approval. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>There

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Once
the evening was over, Dawn retreated to her room. She dismissed the servants,
stripped and let her hair down, collapsing exhausted into bed. In spite of a
night without sleep, in the wake of months of fitful rest, she found herself
staring at the ceiling and brooding. Before leaving, Dusk had taken her aside
to talk about the demon threat in more detail. As she had feared, he did not
take her into his full confidence and she had found herself debating how to
lure him into a full confession. Over the past ten years, she had noticed some
bizarre traits and habits on the part of Dusk and a few of his companions and
she wondered if she could use her observations to trip him into a confession.
When she pressed him to explain his mysterious departure<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>the day before, he confided that he had
received a dire warning of a demon that embodied the very threat he had hinted
at.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>While
he discussed his concerns about how to go about locating this particular demon,
she toyed with the idea of telling him that she had followed him through a door
and behind a curtain which led to a world beyond her comprehension. Not sure
whether it should have been possible for her to do so, however, she counseled
herself against it. Instead, she forced herself to focus on the problem he
presented. She asked him specific questions about what his informant had been
able to tell him about the demon, how he had identified it as a threat to this
world, searching for some clue as to its nature or motives. He told her the
demon was instructed to discover the secrets which ensured the integrity of
reality. She asked if he knew who or what possessed those secrets, stating that
would be the obvious target. He assured her that only the Goddess knew such
secrets, and she smiled and told him that their demon would reveal itself by
seeking some way to get to the goddess.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The
disturbing part of that was the thought that it might succeed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>How
was she supposed to go to sleep with such a dreadful thought on her mind? She
found herself dwelling on her most recent nightmare. She could clearly recall
overhearing a man observing the critical role demons appeared to play in the
Phoenix Massacres. Was it possible that the destruction of her House was
evidence of demonic attacks against the Goddess? It seemed such a perfect
hypothesis she felt an instinctive urge to discredit it, but she did not know
where to start. She was impatient for morning to arrive so she could share her
suspicions with Dusk. Thinking about talking to Dusk led to thinking about Dusk
and eventually to her first serious contemplation of the prospect of being
married to him. She finally drifted off, wondering how a relationship between
two individuals from two separate realities could possibly work, and her
subconscious mind took over working on the hypothesis.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Her
dreams skittered through a number of romantic formulas, dancing wantonly in and
out of erotic situations frustrated by a lover who turned into smoke and light
when she embraced him, or who turned away from her shocking transformations
into the male version of herself. This frustration opened the door for her
inevitable nightmares, as demons marched in to destroy all her illusions of a
happy life, chased by faceless entities that caused everything the demons
touched to melt into formless mist. Caught between this twin menace, Dawn
exploded awake panting and cursing under her breath. Collapsing back, she
stared sightlessly at the ceiling for an hour, trying to sort through the
images. It had been months since her nights had been plagued by any insecurity
about her sexuality. Except when something forced her to remember, she had not
even thought about it when she was awake. Apparently, resolving the problem
within herself did not answer her fears about what Dusk, who had witnessed most
of her ordeal, thought about it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>It
was just one more thing that would have to be brought out into the open and
discussed. Rising from the bed, she crossed the room to confront herself in the
mirror. Candle wicks burst into flame in response to her desire for more light,
as she studied the image of herself. She was tall and slender, in excellent
athletic condition. The curves of her hips and breasts more than sufficient to
proclaim her womanhood. She might have been a touch androgynous in a loose
shirt and breeches, but there was nothing overtly masculine in her form or
bearing. The fact that she could still change that with a thought was balanced
by the fact that she had no particular desire to move in that direction. The
confusion that had once made her condition uncontrollable had been laid to
rest. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>She
still did not know why the problem had been created in the first place. But she
had figured out who she was and, by that, what she was. She never wanted to go
through that struggle again. When she went over, fetching a shirt and pants
from her wardrobe, and slipped them on, she was confident that her choice was
based on the convenience and freedom of movement those clothes allowed her in
combat. In that, she was no different from any other female initiate. The only
difference was that she had had a taste of the other side of life. The good and
the bad, and her experience had made her wiser. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Rather
than worrying about what he thought of her as a woman, she should be more
concerned about Dusk’s opinion of her as a person. As she listened to the peal
of four bells, she sighed and shrugged. She had some time to kill before she
could start working on that problem, but a nice long walk would help her
dismiss these other disturbances and give her a chance to go over the problems
her regent had dropped on her. The worst possible outcome, was that she missed
trials and her marriage to Dusk turned her into a well pampered homebody with
no voice in politics and an aborted education. The life of choice for a lot of
women who became initiates just to acquire suitable husbands. By traditional
views, a very respectable accomplishment for a woman, and preferable to the
usual alternative of becoming a priestess. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Dawn
stopped in the vestibule to slip into her boots and cloak before stepping out
into the misty, predawn chill. Dream Gate, on the Phoenix Coast, was in the
southernmost reaches of the shattered continent, so it was not intolerably
cold. She pulled her cloak tight to keep out the wind, streaming in off the
sea, and followed the ridge road to the north edge of the port. She let her
feet guide her as she contemplated the Goddess’s response to Dusk’s petition.
If Amber had been right, and she was destined to become a paladin, there was
little chance that the Goddess would give her blessing to the union. If the
Goddess wanted her to marry Dusk, she might offer her blessing, but place some
condition upon them which would allow Dawn to complete the trials. Of course,
she still had to be tested by Master Vinewood, but after her experience with
that demon on the Threshold, her response to them had changed significantly. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Her
mind detoured into a sobering contemplation of that alien realm. These thoughts
kept her company as she wandered through the early morning. Arriving at the
north ridge cliffs, some time after five bells, she sought out the warmth of an
inn. The north ridge housed the merchants, sea-men and fishermen whose trade
kept them tied to the sea, and the shops and kitchens of the establishments
that serviced them were open and bustling before the earliest light. Because of
this convenience, the same facilities attracted the city guards, pausing from
their rounds or before and after their posting, to warm and refresh themselves.
Dawn should have been thinking about where this tidbit of knowledge had come
from, because then she would have been prepared for her next confrontation. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“Well.
If it isn’t the prodigal son,” a familiar voice crowed from behind her. She
knew the voice as well as she knew Amber’s. A voice of wisdom, warning and
instruction. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“Thorn,”
she turned and greeted her other mentor by name. She resisted the urge to hug
him. In his mind she was still a boy, and that display of affection would
instantly wake his disapproval. “What are you doing here?”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“When
I lost the battle to preserve my charge,” he began, referring to the events of
the preceding year, “I was forced to seek another line of employment.
Fortunately, Dream Gate can always use a good soldier. They made me a captain
of the guard.” He studied her features while she tried to think of a response.
It had seriously cost him to preserve her secret. “You’ve matured into a
beautiful girl,” he murmured, in a slightly pained voice.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“It’s
better than flipping back and forth, or being split into two people again,” she
replied. She had already explained her decision to him, and her reasons. What
more was there to say?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“Did

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“With
who?” she cut him off, knowing what he was about to suggest again, “That girl
my father tried to marry me off to? Correction, that man who claimed he was my
father?” Thorn said nothing. “I have more respect for Raven. Should I have
given Dusk a try too? Compare and contrast? Is that how you think it works?”
Thorn grunted and shook his head. He wandered away without further comment and
she folded her arms and cradled her head on the table. That had not gone well.
Worse, the cryptic exchange had drawn some attention, and people were staring
at her. She finished her drink and stormed out of the inn. She felt more
comfortable out in the cold.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:150%'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>She
clambered down the rocky cliff to the beach, to wade through the waves and
watch the sun come up, wondering what to do about the debt she owed Thorn. She
lost track of time, until half past seven bells when she felt a curious contact
from Dusk. She opened her mind to him and established contact. She was grateful
for the distraction, and the opportunity to share her thoughts with him.
Discovering how far she had wandered down the beach, she turned south to head
back to the port. As she walked, she relayed her thoughts from the previous
evening, including her suspicions that the Phoenix Massacres were evidence of
the rogue demon’s assault on the Goddess. She was sharing her memory of the
nightmare, re-enacting the Dream Gate Massacre, when she noticed she was not
alone on the beach.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>In her distraction she had stumbled
into the midst of a score of campers. That was a slang term they used among
themselves that had somehow come to identify people who remained in Dream Gate
past the conclusion of their initiations to hunt the ruins. They supported
themselves by collecting on the bounties posted for the destruction of demons
or undead that haunted the region. They wandered scattershot along the beach in
groups of two or three, talking to each other in subdued voices. Just as she
was about to dismiss them as harmless, a chill went up her spine. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-fareast-font-family:

apart in an instant. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

"MS Mincho"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>As she stepped
between two groups, they turned to confront her. At the same time, others took
advantage of her open mind to stun her. Three or four campers hammered her in
an explosion of psychic energy. The combined blow momentarily paralyzed her
higher faculties. Her link to Dusk was cut as she recoiled in shock. Her
attackers used the moment to close in on her, drawing weapons. She whirled
instantly into dancing mode, twisting, dodging and evading the group as the
last of them closed in to attack her. With the economy of motion she had been
taught, she used their momentum to disarm, disable or dismiss her opponents in
a pattern that caused people and objects to fly away from her as fast as they
advanced. Because her psychic defenses had been shattered from the outset, she
could not fully recover from the ambush. Her timing and reflexes were disrupted
by additional psychic or sorcerous assaults. Dawn was overpowered on the beach,
and dragged into a cove. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span

grips that kept her immobilized, she continued trying to resist, to keep them
occupied, as she reached inward to regroup. An alarm was going off in her head,
warning her that there was something wrong. The best thing she had to work with
was the fact that she had been in telepathic rapport with Dusk when her
assailants attacked. If he acted quickly, she might survive this. The only
problem was, she was not already dead. It took her a moment to realize why her

a hand clamped around her neck in a strangling grip, choking her words. The

conferred for a moment. One of them, gripping her from behind, cupped a hand
over her breast and spoke harshly in her ear.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

this confirmation. For one second she considered revealing her masculine form,
denying them herself. Unfortunately, her male body was not impenetrable, and
might well provoke a more dangerous response. Training dictated that her first
priority was survival. As horrible as it was, rape could be survived, but
panicked resistance could prove fatal. With the odds so heavily against her,
her best hope was to give them as little of herself as she could. As soon as
they felt her go limp, they began tearing at her clothing. A brutal, symbolic
deflowering shared by the group asserting its claim on her. She denied them the
pleasure of hearing her protest about her virginity. They needed no additional
encouragement. She was already withdrawing into herself, as she had been
taught, when another horrible intuition seized her. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

assailants’ eyes, she saw the kind of menace that had lurked in the eyes of her
mother ten years earlier. Those eyes promised far worse than rape or murder.
They had cleverly used her own training to weaken her for a different kind of
assault entirely. Having no time to verify her suspicion, she acted. Calling
once more on her training, she tried to break away, forcing her consciousness
to anchor itself firmly in her flesh. The instant she sensed another presence
trying to root itself in her body, something inside her snapped, and she
exploded into a blood red rage. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

"MS Mincho"'>Dusk had leapt into motion the instant he lost contact with Dawn.
He had a general idea where she was from the images that had spilled over
during their rapport. He was not as familiar with Dream Gate as Dawn’s alter
ego, but back in the days when her other side was a separate entity, their
rivalry had caused them to become familiar with each others habits and favorite
haunts. It seemed kind of silly now to think that they had started fighting
because they were among the top five initiates of their generation and had the
same name. Now the other Dusk was no more, but his spirit might have guided
Dawn’s footsteps. He raced toward the north beach and arrived in time to see
the carnage unfold.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

nightmares she had just been showing him had erupted into life straight out of
her mind. As he came in sight, he could see her lying pinned in the middle of a
crowd that had ripped open her shirt and stripped the rest of her clothing
completely off. While he closed the distance, he saw the youth stretched on top
of her suddenly disintegrate into a pile of gore. A second later, her gaze
locked on another young man, who also shuddered into a tangle of limbs and
organs spilling free on the sand. Dusk came to a dead stop as Dawn freed an arm
to pick up the sword dropped by her second victim, while two of the men
standing around her lunged in and plunged their swords through her body. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

agony as one blade entered her belly, and the other punched through her chest,
into her right lung. As Dawn screamed, a concussive force exploded outward from
her, throwing blood, sand, bodies and bits away from her. Dusk had to drop onto
his stomach to dodge the two swords she expelled from her flesh. Everyone
scrambled to their feet, but Dawn was already up, propelled by her outburst. As
she dropped to her feet, the sword she had liberated chopped through another
foe’s arm. The fact that she was even up and moving implied that she had sealed
her wounds, and held them closed, with her mind. Her blade twisted through a
tiny arc as she reversed her swing to separate a head from its shoulders. As a
third man lunged for the opening she had left, she glanced at him. Dusk could
actually sense the laser fine thrust from her mind, and feel how it shattered
her opponent.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

and composed, his full faculties available for the fight, but he quickly found
himself taxed just watching her back. She moved with merciless perfection,
slashing, stabbing, striking and shattering one foe after another. At some
point they had started running, but she simply reached out and tore them to
pieces, forcing them to regroup and confront her with all they had left. The
fury that animated her drove her until the last man fell twitching. When she
came to a panting halt and confronted her handiwork, she suddenly snapped out
of her rage and went into shock.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

grip suddenly relaxed and blood started gushing out of her chest and gut, while
she collapsed to her knees and began pitching to the ground. Dusk squatted and caught
her, his mind probing her wounds as he cradled her in his arms. The
regeneration that was part of the dragon and phoenix legacies had not had
enough time to bind her wounds. Like himself, Dawn was better trained in the
psychic arts than the magic arts. That power exacted a more immediate price.
Combined with her shock, and the exhaustion of her unrestrained psychic
onslaught, she was in no condition to repair the damage. Dusk himself had
expended a great deal of his energy racing to the scene and jumping into
combat. But he had enough left to risk a teleport to the Sanctuary, and hand
Dawn over to the healers there. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

bed and went to her side, probing her body with his thoughts to confirm that
her wounds were cleaned and repaired and she was sleeping naturally. He
remembered rousing as he was put into bed and informing someone that Dawn had
been attacked on the beach. There would be questions to answer, especially by
Dawn when she finally woke. An investigation should have already begun. After
brushing Dawn’s hair back from her face and kissing her brow, he slipped out to

apparition of the Goddess appeared and resolved into flesh. Here was the source
of the features which defined the Phoenix House. Dawn was the final offshoot of
the woman the Goddess had resurrected in her own image. Apart from sex, the two
were identical. The Goddess was a unique creature, neither male nor female.
Though she appeared completely androgynous, she had a unique reproductive
system that the gods had adopted, which allowed them to sire or bear children.
They, like her, had the flat chest of a man, but otherwise the proportions of a
tall woman, which encouraged the use of the feminine pronoun. She looked at him

that the game is in jeopardy. I thought that, given the direction things were
going, I only needed to nudge things in a couple of places and the problem
would fix itself. Unfortunately, while I was setting this campaign up, someone
moved to exploit the security flaw. I have a rogue demon, a worm virus programmed
to seek out and crack the security core. Thanks to Dawn, I remembered that

the problem be resolved. With it, the tail can be quickly rooted out. I suspect
the revised worm exploits encapsulated node architecture. There are billions of
places for it to hide, and because those places are in fact the psyche
constructs of the populace, they are almost impossible to search. This thing is
not much different from the infiltration modules you designed to impose the
rules of the game at the point of access. It resides within the interface
protocols of the infected entities, which puts it technically outside the game.
Like any other demon, it can call functions within the game, or another secure
environment with the same architecture, because it’s out on the Threshold
somewhere. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

threats in the world. I know you never looked at it that way, but

conflict all died from their injuries as help arrived. They could do nothing

he had vowed. He was happy to sit down and answer the investigators’ questions,
giving them a complete recap of the morning’s events from his perspective. Dawn
had roused and was brought in after Dusk, to tell her side of the story. By
this point the investigators learned the identities of the campers, and it was
not hard to guess how they might have been possessed by the demons both
survivors claimed were behind the attack. Neither Dusk nor Dawn volunteered to

foils Crimson wonderfully, but what are you looking so damned smug for?” Dusk
demanded, as she sat there studying him with a smirk on her face. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

brings up something we seriously need to talk about.” She fluffed a pillow
somewhat roughly, added it to the stack behind her and leaned back. She
frowned, her eyes flicking over something only she could see as she gathered
her thoughts. “You don’t really think the Goddess said that just for our
convenience, do you?”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

"MS Mincho"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“Oh, rot. We’re
talking about an arranged marriage, Dawn. Our feelings were never taken into
consideration. I’m not happy about having this thrust on me, but I like you a
lot. I don’t have any real objections to you. I just don’t have any personal
desire to get married to anyone.” He sighed and looked her in the eye, “From
the beginning I set my feelings aside and concentrated on doing my duty. I
assumed you did the same.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

"MS Mincho"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“Oh, sure. We
talked about this when we were first told about it,” she agreed. She reached
out and laid her hand on his cheek. “I also seem to recall that you and I had a
number of crushes on each other while we were growing up. We both agreed that a
lot of it was hormones, and the kissing and touching was typical for kids like
us, exploring our sexuality. We agreed that Crimson had set us up with the
perfect excuse to go too far and <i>have</i> to marry early. I think we even
agreed not to fall in love, to keep that from happening.” She took her hand
away and added sternly, “But I am not asking about then. I am asking about
now.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

pulling at the ties, opening her shirt down the front. “I mean, after all that
happened last year, are you afraid I’m not quite the girl I used to be?” she
focused on his eyes, watching as they strayed nervously to her chest. She
continued loosening her shirt, exposing a track from her neck to her navel,
without fully exposing her breasts.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

reached out when she grabbed the lapels of her shirt and began pulling them
back.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

"MS Mincho"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>“Why not? We’ve
been engaged for a year now. You’ve been in my room alone with me for two days
now. You think anyone imagines we haven’t been intimate, or that we haven’t
every right. They can’t rush us to the alter any faster than they are. Why
not?” she stared at him. “We’re good friends. Isn’t that enough for us get
more<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>intimately acquainted?”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

she huffed, folding her hands in her lap. Her shirt fell open a bit more on
it’s own, exposing a hint of her areolas. “I certainly need to do this for me.
I’ve wanted to do this for years, but I… well, first I was afraid you thought
of me as just one of the guys. Then I <i>was</i> one of the guys. That’s all
over now, and I came to trials hoping we could—we would—do this.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span

shook his head and looked down. When he looked back up his face was earnest.
“That never mattered to me. I think you had more trouble with that than I ever
did. I always thought it was fascinating. I admit, I was never turned on by you
as a guy. But, I tend to think that your experience makes you a better woman,
and, Goddess, it’s not like I want to say no. I just don’t feel right about
taking advantage of you. I don’t want to use you for my pleasure.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span

at it like that? What about my pleasure? Do you think the experience isn’t
mutual?” she stared at him, steaming. “There on the beach, when I thought I was
about to be raped, the one thing I regretted was that I had been saving myself
for <i>you</i>.” Dusk remained silent, struggling with the feelings she was
provoking and almost angry that the game could do this to him. With all the
realism, with the complexity of the characters, he had always struggled to keep
from becoming too attached. He shut his eyes as he struggled within for
perspective. He felt her sliding out the opposite side of the bed and looked up
in time to see her nightshirt spill off her shoulders. She stepped out of the
garment, piled at her feet and came around the bed to confront him. “The way
things are going, I could die the next time I step out that door. I always
dreamed that you would come to my bed, in an act of love. But to be perfectly
frank, I’d be happy if you just fucked me. Used me and walked away, because at
least I would know I won’t die a virgin.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=0DraftNormal6 style='line-height:150%;tab-stops:.5in'><span

"MS Mincho"'><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Dusk had been too
distracted by her nudity to rise from the bed. Now she had him pinned against
the edge of the mattress. If he stood, he would be pressed up against her, but
if he tried to retreat over the bed, she would be on top of him in an instant.
It was an absurd situation. He grabbed her hands and clasped them together in
his own, conveniently putting an obstacle between their bodies. “Dawn. I
understand. I really do. This is just not the time. You’re still recovering
from the fight. If you keep pushing you could get hurt and your injuries might
scar. We can’t afford that, not with trials coming up.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

another answer,” she pleaded. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

enough to get you excited. But you,” she emphasized, pulling away from him and
stalking over to a mirror, “you keep talking about how <i>you</i> feel. You
don’t want me to indulge <i>your </i>desires. <i>You </i>don’t want to <i>use </i>me.
Like what <i>I</i> want doesn’t even enter the picture.<br>
<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>She turned and glared at him, “Do you
know what that sounds like to me? It sounds like the only person who is real to
you is <i>you</i>.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>
