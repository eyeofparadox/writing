human first incarnation - a raped familiar

a woman possessed by a demon infects a man with familiarity
she was a ninteen year old companion to a twenty-nine year old master - and mentor to a nine year old protege
she had dedicated her life to the academy and the art, even though this meant she could not marry
her possession resulted from her capture at the hands of a rogue master

a man raped by a demon once their forms have been exchanged by the infection
he was a ninteen year old companion to a twenty-nine year old master - and mentor to a nine year old protege
he had dedicated his life to the academy, the art and a life of adventure, in place of pursuing a girl he could never have
his mentor's adversary, a rogue academy peer, captured the girl he loved and he defied orders to rescue her

the boy encounters the girl for the first time at the academy where they find themselves in rival houses
the boy is placed in the dragon house, following in his father's footsteps 

during the initiations of the boy and the girl, the man and woman undertake more demanding missions as their mentors' agents
officially, their service to the academy ended upon completion of their mentorships
technically free agents, they served more as troubleshooters and investigators than spies 
on many occasions they each received commissions from the crown, serving as royal agents at home and abroad

the girl is often regarded as the only survivor of the massacre, but this is only partly true
the girl was the only survivor who confronted a demon assassin unarmed and defended herself successfully
the victims of the massacre included almost half of the staff and a little more than a hundred senior students
the girl did not remember the encounter when she finally returned to her senses

the girl had been easy for the demon to manipulate into taking over the tomboy's date
the girl had expected the evening to wind up in bed, but could not believe it had ended in rape and slaughter




human first incarnation - splintered realms

< previously mapped > reality splits into branches exploring every possibility but these splintered realms tend to flow along the same channels even in spite of profound differences. this premise is exploited to allow the male and female incarnations of a soul to confront each other. 

in one world he was conceived and born a boy
in one world she was conceived and born a girl
in all other respects, everything was the same until the night of the massacre
in both realms, they were confronted by their mother who was possessed by a demon assassin
each tore at the fabric of reality with his or her mind as the demon tried to rip out their soul

the girl hesitated on the brink of destroying her mother, taking possession of the demon to free her soul instead
she acted just in time to stop her father from slaying her mother
she managed a blind teleport within her realm taking her mother with her

the boy and his father were sucked into the rift opened by their combined attacks
they emerged in the girl's realm where she had weakened the fabric of reality during her own struggle
the girl's father was stunned by the arrival of the boy - rendered unconscious by his ordeal - and his father

with the help of "their" mentor, the boy's father figured out what had happened
the boy was traumatized by his role in the death of his mother
the boy was relieved to discover she had survived in this realm - and shocked to learn this reality's version of him was a girl

by the time the girl recovered from her trauma her parents had decided not to burden her with the full truth
the boy and his father were introduced to the girl as her cousin and uncle
she was told that the boy's mother had died in the massacre
in spite of her domination, the girl was not the only soul in the demon's sphere of influence
in the years to come, she would fall prey to captive souls challenging her dominion over the demon 

when the girl asserts her dominion, she is essentially a goddess - though she tends to repress the power, remaining a mere girl
the souls seeking to attain dominion tend to be dominated, resurrecting the demon until the girl reasserts her dominion
when the girl reasserts dominion over the demon, the soul is released from its influence and passes on
a soul in dominion over the demon is on equal footing with her; it's not within her power to disposses such a soul
this is one instance where she could be forced to sacrifice an incarnation of herself

< implications > the advantage of this approach is that it allows several threads used by the parents in other approaches to be used by the main character. the boy can become infected with familiarity by the girl during one of her possessions - or his mother at the time of the massacre. the mother can be involved with "twins". this approach also incorporates the themes and threads associated with the rift, including the exploration of the principles of space, time and mind as media with their own dimensions. 

< sticking point > the problem with the use of familiarity is that it goes both ways, meaning she would not really be forced to sacrifice her male incarnation. the alternative is to use the demonic ring for the boy's ordeal with turning female or to have him infected with familiarity by his mother before crossing the rift. the latter allows for his sacrifice to also create her "evil" twin and nemesis. in addition, the infection would put the boy in a situation where he must turn into a girl on brief occasions, often unwillingly. his curse and his awareness of the girl tempt and torment him, in keeping with the ordeal he faces while the girl struggles with the demon within her. an alternative would be for the girl to be eclipsed by the demon of the realm and manifest in a female form when she ascends.
